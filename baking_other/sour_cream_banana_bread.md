sour cream banana bread
-----

# manifesto

Optimizes for: light, spongy, fluffy, non-greasy, not too sweet. More like a breakfast bread than a dessert/cake, as traditional banana breads often are. This is a life staple I made up in college. Great for roadtrips, camping, and breakfast.

Delayed gratification caveat: requires an overnight in the fridge.

# ingredients

Dry:
+ 1-1/2 cups flour
+ 1 tsp baking soda
+ 1/2 tsp salt

Wet:
+ 2 eggs
+ 3/4 cup brown sugar
+ 1 tsp vanilla
+ a dash of cinnamon, if you want
+ 1/3 cup oil (I use canola)
+ 3/4 cup sour cream
+ 3 to 4 squishy bananas

# methodology

+ Mix the dry ingredients.
+ Mix the wet ingredients in a separate bowl.
+ Mix the wet ingredients thoroughly into the dry ones. A whisk helps.

Bake for 350F for 50-60 minutes (or until a toothpick comes out clean).

+ If you're a sucker for that caramelized-brown crust, split it into two 9x5 loaf pans or one 9x9 pan.
+ If you prefer the center to the crust, use one 9x5 loaf pan. This will yield a loaf with a square-ish cross-section.

Leave it in the fridge overnight to maximize flavor/moistness.
