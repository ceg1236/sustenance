# Core kitchenware
- 15" wok, 12" cast iron pan, stockpot, colander, $15 rice cooker

# Super easy fast meals I make a lot with my pantry staples

## 2 minute meal
- hummus pickle toast lunch
- chickpea salad (can of chickpeas, vegan mayo, a lot of paprika, vegan bacon salt, optional sprouts)

## 15 minute meal

### Rice bowl
random stir fried protein & random veggie over coconut/sushi rice with side of pickles (DIY or japanese)

Rice: either a tablespoon of coconut oil in the rice cooker, or a spoon-per-bowl of sushi seasoning after it comes out

Favorite protein options (best results in a cast iron)
- smoky black beans w/ semi-caramelized onions (cheating w/ liquid smoke)
- toasty tofu triangles (works best with TJ's power tofu) with Taiwanese "pepper salt for fried chicken"

Favorite veggie options (usually in a wok)
- Purple cabbage stir-fried with some fennel seeds
- Chrysanthemum greens or onchoy stir-fried with ginger, sesame oil
- More robust chinese greens stir fried with ginger, garlic, vegan oyster sauce
- Any random dark leafy green with a bit of oil and salt (always start with diced stems, then add leaves at the end)
- Collard greens with a can of coconut milk
- No time to cook greens? Just eat pickles. Or sprouts (requires some premeditation)

## 10-15 minutes of actual work, but some additional waiting needed
- roasted diced beets & carrots (dice to bite size, drizzle with oil, roast at ~425F until done)
- honey-caramelized chinese eggplants (stir-fried in 3:2:1 blend of soy sauce, shaoxing wine, chinkiang black vinegar)
- tempeh satay (steam tempeh in microwave, marinate for 24 hours, fry)
- pasta with capers, stir-fried onions, oyster mushrooms
- high-hydration ciabatta lmao
