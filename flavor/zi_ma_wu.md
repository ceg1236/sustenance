# zi ma wu (黑芝麻糊)

Traditionally, you would toast and grind the black sesame yourself and use rice soaked overnight; this is the easy lazy version.

### Sources

You want extremely fine-ground, toasted black sesame paste.

Unflavored tahini is a great shortcut so long as the sesame is toasted before use. Note that many tahinis are made from raw sesame, which will taste bitter, or have added flavorings which you won't want in zi ma wu.

- Kevala black sesame tahini: the least expensive option I've found that hits all the base requirements and is also peanut-allergy-safe.
- マルホン 純ねり胡麻 (Maruhon black sesame paste): apparently the quality splurge option. Sometimes mistransliterated as Marumoto.

### Instructions

- 1 unit finely ground toasted black sesame paste
- 1 unit rice flour, such as Mochiko
- 3/4 unit cane sugar
- 3.5 units hot water

Blend and adjust sugar and water to taste. I like zi ma wu thick at the consistency of honey, and not too sweet.

To fill a large mug, set 1 unit = 1/4 cup. For a smaller serving, set 1 unit = chinese soup spoon.
