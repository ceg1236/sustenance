zi ma wu (黑芝麻糊)
-----

(Traditionally, you would toast and grind the black sesame yourself and use rice soaked overnight; this is the easy lazy version.)

*Ingredients*
- 1 unit unflavored black sesame tahini, aka finely ground toasted black sesame. I use Kevala
- 1 unit rice flour, such as Mochiko
- 3/4 unit cane sugar
- 3.5 units hot water

Blend and adjust sugar and water to taste. I like zi ma wu thick at the consistency of honey, and not too sweet.

To fill a large mug, set 1 unit = 1/4 cup. For a smaller serving, set 1 unit = chinese soup spoon.
