acute sore throat
-----
researched this during crippling bout of tonsillitis

### to do frequently
1. warm salt water gargle (studies mostly demonstrate efficacy of plain water gargles, but a little osmosis doesnâ€™t hurt)
2. honey shots [^honey1][^honey2] (+ can add honey in everything to follow to make it more palatable)

### additional remedies seemingly backed by data, if you get desperate
1. make a tea from honey, lemon, ginger, cloves[^cloves1][^cloves2][^cloves3]
2. raw crushed garlic [^garlic1][^garlic2] (chew on a whole clove, suck on a piece, or crush it and add honey)
3. echinacea/sage topical (similar efficacy to chlorhexidine/lidocaine as an antimicrobial/anesthetic for acute sore throat treatment [^echinacea-sage]). I use it as a gargle
4. topical of essential oils on external swollen areas? lemongrass[^lemongrass], lavender[^lavender], maybe eucalyptus. (dilute 6 tsp carrier oil to 15 drops essential oil to avoid irritation; jojoba is a neutral non-comedogenic carrier)
5. warm compress on external swollen areas. (can also add essential oils directly to this without a carrier)

## caveats
- antibiotics are prescribed because they reduce contagion time from ~2 weeks to ~24 hours after antibiotics, and to eliminate the (very rare, but life-threatening) risk of rheumatic fever
