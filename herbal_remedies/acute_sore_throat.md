acute sore throat
-----
researched this during crippling bout of tonsillitis

## to do frequently
1. warm salt water gargle (studies mostly demonstrate efficacy of plain water gargles, but a little osmosis doesnâ€™t hurt)
2. honey shots [^https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609166/] (+ can add honey in everything to follow to make it more palatable)

## additional remedies seemingly backed by data, if you get desperate
1. make a tea from honey, lemon, ginger, cloves (antimicrobial, antiinflammatory [^http://www.bioline.org.br/pdf?gm05035], anesthetic) [^https://www.ijrap.net/admin/php/uploads/360_pdf.pdf] [^https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8904847]
2. raw crushed garlic [^https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29109311][^https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30397374] (chew on a whole clove, suck on a piece, or crush it and add honey)
3. echnicaca/sage topical (similar efficacy to chlorhexidine/lidocaine as an antimicrobial/anesthetic for acute sore throat treatment [^https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3351972/]). I use it as a gargle
4. topical of essential oils on external swollen areas? lemongrass [^https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/ljm.v9.25431], lavender[^https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26247152], maybe eucalyptus. (dilute 6 tsp carrier oil to 15 drops essential oil to avoid irritation; jojoba is a neutral non-comedogenic carrier)
5. warm compress on external swollen areas. (can also add essential oils directly to this without a carrier)

## caveats
- antibiotics are prescribed because they reduce contagion time from ~2 weeks to ~24 hours after antibiotics, and to eliminate the (very rare, but life-threatening) risk of rheumatic fever
