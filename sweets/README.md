# sweets

### heuristics

+ I lack a sweet tooth. As a general rule, this manifests as 25-35% less sugar than standard recipes.
+ I like being punched in the tongue with flavors. This usually manifests as double the spice of standard recipes.

Adjust in the reverse direction accordingly if you do not share these parameters.
