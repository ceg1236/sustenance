-----

### manifesto
- spicy-sweet bite of candied ginger tempered by the earthy-sweet softness of baked pear
- the complexity of molasses coupled with the satisfying crumb of gingerbread
- juxtaposition of textures
- not too sweet pls

I arrange steps to minimize idle time / maximize interval scheduling.

## recipe
Delayed gratification caveat: requires an overnight in the fridge.

ingredients: WHERE DID THESE GO

Preheat oven to 350F.

### Pear upside-down topping

Slice two pears about 1/4" thick. Coat the bottom of 9" pan with melted butter.

Mix the rest of the ingredients together, and sprinkle it over the top. Arrange pear slices over that.

### Candied ginger

Warning: I LOVE GINGER.

You can chop up premade candied ginger, but I prefer to make it.

Peel a piece of ginger root about 3" x 1". Slice thinly and mince up the pieces. You could try a food processor too. You'll end up with somewhere between 2 and 4 tablespoons of ginger.

Put that in a small pot with enough water to cover it and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Bring to a boil, then let simmer gently while you mix the cake. (Make sure you don't run out of water.

### Cake/assemble

Sift together the dry ingredients. In a separate bowl, beat together wet ingredients. You might have to warm the butter a little.

Dice your third pear finely and stir it into the batter.

Taste your candied ginger. If it's to your liking, strain it and mix the ginger into the batter. (You can use the ginger syrup for something else.)

Pour everything over the pears in the pan.

Bake for 1 hour or until a toothpick comes out clean.

Cool for at least 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edge to loosen the cake from the pan, invert into a container suitable for storage, and refrigerate overnight. (This recipe is calibrated to require an overnight to settle into its full flavor. It will be mediocre if you eat it now.)
