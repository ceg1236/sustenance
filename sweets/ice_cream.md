# homemade ice cream

## bases

### fat-water ratio

The goal here is to hit the freezing point sweet spot such that the ice cream stays sufficiently solid in the freezer, yet does not take forever to become edible when you want to eat it.

Base target fat-water ratio seems to be a little under 20%. A 1:1 ratio of heavy cream and milk is the easiest base.

Alcohol significantly lowers the freezing temperature. Haven't sufficiently tested / phase diagrammed enough yet to instruct. In vague heuristics, I recall incrementally adding nearly a cup of water to less than three cups of base containing about 1.5 shots of 100 proof whiskey to get it to solidify.

### stabilizers

Stabilizers stabilize your fat-water emulsion, which is desirable because it means your ice cream will stay creamy and smooth instead of forming flaky ice crystals.

- guar gum: 1/8 tsp to 1 cup base
- eggs
