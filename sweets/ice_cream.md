# homemade ice cream

my proudest ice cream achievement was making a mexican iced chocolate flavored ice cream for a group of people whose food sensitivities included: lactose intolerance, anaphylactic nut allergy, soy allergy, coconut allergy.

I devised a vegan oat milk & olive oil base with the correct fat:water ratio and stabilized it with guar gum.

## bases

### fat-water ratio

The goal here is to hit the freezing point sweet spot such that the ice cream stays sufficiently solid in the freezer, yet does not take forever to become edible when you want to eat it.

Base target fat-water ratio seems to be a little under 20%. The easiest base is a slightly less than 1:1 ratio (for example, 8:7) of heavy cream to whole milk.

Alcohol significantly lowers the freezing temperature. Haven't sufficiently tested / phase diagrammed enough yet to instruct. In vague heuristics, I recall incrementally adding nearly a cup of water to less than three cups of base containing about 1.5 shots of 100 proof whiskey to get it to solidify.

### stabilizers

Stabilizers stabilize your fat-water emulsion, which is desirable because it means your ice cream will stay creamy and smooth instead of forming flaky ice crystals.

- guar gum: 1/8-1/4 tsp per 1 cup base
- xanthan gum: 1/8-1/4 tsp per 1 cup base [[icecreamgeek](https://www.icecreamgeek.com/?p=664)]
- eggs: ~6 per quart base [[seriouseats](https://sweets.seriouseats.com/2013/08/how-many-eggs-should-i-use-to-make-ice-cream.html)]

## technique

### flavor integration

For flavorants that are already rendered into an easily dissolvable form, such as powders (cardamom, matcha) or pastes (black sesame), whisk them in before the churning step.

For anything else, I infuse the flavorant and the desired sugar amount into simple syrup first, a few hours ahead so it can get cold in the fridge.

The end volume of the syrup is difficult to control, so I just account in the final base as if it were the equivalent volume of water.
