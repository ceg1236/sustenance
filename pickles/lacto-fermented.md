# Lacto-fermented pickles
-----
Great source of probiotics, easy way to transmute inexpensive raw veggies into readily available dinner toppings, great way to add color to a meal.

## Generalized methodology
By brining chopped vegetables at room temperature over a long period of time, you cultivate an environment beneficial to Lactobacillus, a bacterial friend we have co-evolved with which partners with us on many kinds of fermentation and is crucial to our gut health.

Lactobacillus breaks down the food to make additional nutrients more bioavailable to us, and also imparts a unique pickle flavor.

This method produces gas over the course of the fermentation, so you'll need a way to release the pressure.

## Tools needed
- **Coarse salt.** I use Diamond Crystal kosher salt because I can get very large inexpensive boxes at the local restaurant supply store, but any kind of coarse salt is fine.
- **Large (1-3L) glass jars.** I use canning jars with a wire bail and rubber gasket, which autoburp themselves when the pressure builds up. They do leak juice, so I put a plate under them to catch it. You can actually use any old jars, but without a pressure release, you'll have to remember to burp them manually every couple days so they don't explode, which is a lot of work.
- **A long blunt object for smashing down vegetables.** I use the end of a French rolling pin to smash down my veggies, but you can use whatever you've got that fits in a jar.
- Knife, veggies, and water!

# "Recipes"
(Not actually recipes so much as suggestions/preferences. Tweak to suit your preferences.)


## Purple Sauerkraut

Great as a rice bowl topping, alongside homefries, or pretty much anywhere you need a bit of sourness and crunch to balance a carb-heavy meal.

### Ingredients
- one large purple cabbage
- 1-2 Tbsp fennel seed
- about 1/2 cup coarse salt
- a 2-3L canning jar

### Process
1. Sprinkle a hefty pinch of coarse salt in the bottom of the jar. 
2. Quarter a purple cabbage and start slicing it up.
3. Layer handfuls of cabbage and 1-2 hefty pinches of salt per layer, plus fennel seed to taste. (Use as much fennel as you would season a cooked food with.)
4. When the jar is about half full, start smashing down the cabbage.
5. Continue layering and smashing until it is not possible to get any more cabbage in the jar. The salt will have started breaking down the cabbage after several minutes. You should be able to get the cabbage juices to nearly cover all the cabbage, but not quite.
6. Add just enough water to cover the cabbage. Optional: you can also add weights if you have them to submerge everything beneath the surface. I don't use weights and it's fine.
7. Write the date on the jar and shelve it. Put a plate underneath to catch leaked juice. I enjoy it best after a minimum of 1 month, though you can open it early if you are impatient.

Once opened, store in the refrigerator.


## Moroccan preserved lemons

The preservation process mellows the lemon flavor in a very unique and indescribable way. These are too salty to eat like a normal pickle. I either slice up small amounts to use as a garnish, or use them in marinades / sauces (omitting any additional salt I would normally add).

### Ingredients
- 8 Meyer lemons
- about 1/2 cup coarse salt
- a 2-3L jar
- (optional) lemon juice

This preserve doesn't produce much gas, so I use a normal jar instead of a canning jar for it.

### Process
1. Sprinkle a hefty pinch of coarse salt in the bottom of the jar.
2. Slice the lemons almost into quarters, but leave the quarters attached at one end. Generously rub them inside and out with salt, then push them into the jar.
3. Smash them down into the jar until they all fit.
4. Cover with lemon juice, or with more water otherwise.
5. Date the jar and shelve for a minimum of 1 month.
