# PICKLES

- [lacto-fermented.md](lacto-fermented.md) - Lacto fermented salt pickles. Fermented for at least 1 month at room temperature.
- [quickles.md](quickles.md) - Quick pickles. Ready in 20 minutes to 2 days.

## Types of veggies to use
You can probably use anything, but I personally prefer the textural results from hard, crisp, crunchy vegetables the most: cabbage, onions, daikon, radishes, cucumbers, carrots, etc.

## Spices
I choose spices by tasting random things in my spice rack and seeing what would go with the vegetable I'm fermenting. Don't take my word for my spice suggestions; try your own!
