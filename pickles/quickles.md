# Quickles (quick pickles)
-----
Quick pickles that are ready within 1-2 days. I try to eat them within a week or two. These undergo some flavor transmutation, although they don't undergo the same process as lacto-fermented pickles. These don't require a pressure release mechanism, so you can use any old glass jar for these.

## Crunchy red ume quickles 
Ume vinegar and red onion are both extremely strong flavors, but they somehow mellow out and transmute into a much gentler flavor very quickly. I can eat these indefinitely.

- Ume plum vinegar
- 3-4 red onions
- 1 small daikon
- 2-3L glass jar

Slice the onions and daikon into bite-sized pieces and cover with ume vinegar. Add water if needed to cover. Refrigerate and wait 2 days to eat.

## Banh mi quickles
Great over rice bowls, in sandwiches, as a snack, etc.

- 2 Persian cucumbers
- 1-2 carrots
- fist-sized chunk of daikon
- rice vinegar
- 1L glass jar

Julienne all the vegetables into bite sized sticks. Pack tightly into a jar. Cover halfway with rice vinegar and dilute the rest of the way with water. Refrigerate and wait 1 day to eat.

## 20-minute quickles
Great when you are completely out of pickles and crave pickles.

- 1 Persian cucumber
- rice vinegar

20 minutes before the rest of your food is ready to eat, slice the cucumber into thin strips and cover with rice vinegar in a bowl.
