# Quickles (quick pickles)
-----
Quick pickles that are ready within 1-2 days. I try to eat cucumber quickles within a week or two. Onions last longer. 

These undergo some flavor transmutation, although they don't undergo the same process as lacto-fermented pickles. These don't require a pressure release mechanism, so you can use any old glass jar for these.

## Banh mi pickles
Great over rice bowls, in sandwiches, as a snack, etc.

- 2 Persian cucumbers
- 1-2 carrots
- fist-sized chunk of daikon
- rice vinegar
- 1L glass jar

Julienne all the vegetables into bite sized sticks. Pack tightly into a jar. Cover halfway with rice vinegar and dilute the rest of the way with water. Refrigerate and wait 1 day to eat.

You can reuse this vinegar at least a few times and it'll continue to work.

## 20-minute pickles
Great when you are completely out of pickles and urgently crave pickles.

- 1 Persian cucumber
- rice vinegar

20 minutes before the rest of your food is ready to eat, slice the cucumber into thin strips and cover with rice vinegar in a bowl.

This vinegar can also be reused.

## Crunchy red ume pickles 
Ume vinegar and red onion are both extremely strong flavors, but they somehow mellow out and transmute into a much gentler flavor very quickly. I can eat these indefinitely. I've had a jar of these around for several months before and they never seemed to go bad. Even toddlers like them!

- Ume plum vinegar
- red onions -- 2 large ones or 3-4 small ones
- 1 small daikon (I don't always include this)
- 2-3L glass jar

Slice the onions and daikon into bite-sized pieces. Pour in the ume plum vinegar and top off with water if you don't have enough. Liquid should be at least 50% vinegar. Refrigerate and wait at least 2-3 days to eat.

Unfortunately, you can't reuse this vinegar for future pickle batches because of how much onion flavor ends up in the vinegar. I tried it and the reused vinegar didn't transmute the new onions very well.
