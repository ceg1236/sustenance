# Quickles (quick pickles)
-----
Quick pickles that are ready within 1-2 days. I try to eat them within a week or two. These undergo some flavor transmutation, although they don't undergo the same process as lacto-fermented pickles. These don't require a pressure release mechanism, so you can use any old glass jar for these.

## Banh mi pickles
Great over rice bowls, in sandwiches, as a snack, etc.

- 2 Persian cucumbers
- 1-2 carrots
- fist-sized chunk of daikon
- rice vinegar
- 1L glass jar

Julienne all the vegetables into bite sized sticks. Pack tightly into a jar. Cover halfway with rice vinegar and dilute the rest of the way with water. Refrigerate and wait 1 day to eat.

You can reuse this vinegar at least a few times and it'll continue to work.

## 20-minute pickles
Great when you are completely out of pickles and urgently crave pickles.

- 1 Persian cucumber
- rice vinegar

20 minutes before the rest of your food is ready to eat, slice the cucumber into thin strips and cover with rice vinegar in a bowl.

This vinegar can also be reused.

## Crunchy red ume pickles 
Ume vinegar and red onion are both extremely strong flavors, but they somehow mellow out and transmute into a much gentler flavor very quickly. I can eat these indefinitely.

- Ume plum vinegar
- 3-4 red onions
- 1 small daikon
- 2-3L glass jar

Slice the onions and daikon into bite-sized pieces and cover with ume vinegar. Add water if needed to cover. Refrigerate and wait 2 days to eat.

You can't effectively reuse the vinegar for these (onions are strong enough that they don't seem to transmute in reused vinegar), which is unfortunate because ume vinegar is pretty expensive in the States.
