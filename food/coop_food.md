## lentil soup

start an amount of rice in the rice cooker (I usually throw in a glob of coconut oil)

classic western soup base:
- saute minced garlic & diced onion in large pot
- add diced celery & carrots
- dump in 3+ cups lentils, cumin, coriander, and enough broth to cover everything
- optional: add lemon juice & zest
- simmer ~30 min, salt to taste

lentil curry:
- saute on low heat in a generous amount of coconut oil: minced garlic, diced onions, julienned ginger, curry powder, turmeric, black pepper
- add 3+ cups lentils, as much coconut cream as you are willing to buy, and pad out the rest of the fluid volume with broth
- simmer ~30 min, salt to taste
- top with chopped cilantro and/or tangy yogurt

## taco bar (choose your own adventure)
