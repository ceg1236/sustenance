coop food

i.e., feeding balanced macronutrients to a large quantity of people with assorted dietary restrictions in under 1.5 hours

when I say "an amount of rice", that means:
- if you don't want leftover rice, use 1/3 to 1/2 dry cup per person depending on your audience's rice interest
- if you want to make fried rice tomorrow, fill the rice cooker to the max

## lentil soup

start an amount of rice in the rice cooker (I usually throw in a glob of coconut oil)

classic western soup base:
- saute minced garlic & diced onion in large pot
- add diced celery & carrots
- dump in 3+ cups lentils, cumin, coriander, and enough broth to cover everything. lentils want a 3:1 water ratio.
- optional: add lemon juice & zest
- simmer ~30 min, salt to taste

lentil curry:
- saute on low heat in a generous amount of coconut oil: minced garlic, diced onions, julienned ginger, curry powder, turmeric, black pepper
- add 3+ cups lentils, and broth at a 3:1 liquid:lentils ratio. for extra luxury you can sub in coconut cream for some of the liquids.
- simmer ~30 min, salt to taste
- top with chopped cilantro and/or tangy yogurt

## taco bar (choose your own adventure)

start an amount of rice in the rice cooker, maybe add cilantro/lime

- bean base: saute onions, add black beans, dash of liquid smoke, [vegan bacon salt](../spices/vegan_bacon_salt.md) maybe
- gently heat a stack of tortillas ~1 minute each in a pan and store covered to retain heat
- topping options: chopped cilantro, sour cream, diced red onions, shredded cheese, guacamole, lime wedges, hot sauce

## stirfry

this doesn't scale well past 8 people unless you have two woks and/or a sous chef to help chop

start an amount of rice in the rice cooker, add a glob of coconut oil

protein base: high-protein (pre-pressed) tofu, cut into little sticks or triangles
- if I'm feeling lazy: stirfry quickly in vegan oyster sauce
- if I'm feeling spicy: tofu sticks with julienned ginger and thai chili paste
- if I'm feeling crunchy: toasty tofu triangles with Taiwanese "pepper salt for fried chicken" seasoning (works best in cast iron with potato starch for extra crisp)

veggies:
- heat up a splash of neutral oil and a drizzle of sesame oil
- saute julienned ginger & optionally minced garlic if you have time
- add chopped chinese dark leafy greens; my favorites are chrysanthemum greens, on choy, yin choy. other solid options include bok choy, gai lan, spinach
- (sometimes if I'm feeling purple I'll do purple cabbage lightly stir-fried with fennel seeds instead)

serve with side/garnish of premade east asian pickles (I usually default to 福神漬, 柴漬け, pickled mustard greens, pickled ginger, or kimchi)

### thai curry variant

- use a can of coconut cream and a few stalks of smashed lemongrass when you make the rice
- simmer the protein and veggies together in thai curry paste and more coconut cream with broth
