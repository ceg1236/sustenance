### Heuristics

[The Food Lab explanation](https://www.seriouseats.com/2011/04/the-food-lab-how-to-make-scallion-pancakes-chinese-appetizers.html)

Doughs made with cold water (most western breads/pastries) have more gluten formation and elasticity. Hot water doughs (often found in Chinese food) have denatured proteins. This prevents structure formation and leads to tender dough with little elasticity.

## Ingredients

### Pancakes

- 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting work surface
- up to 1 cup boiling water
- up to 1/4 cup toasted sesame oil
- 2 cups thinly sliced scallions

### Dipping sauce
- 2 Tbsp soy sauce
- 2 Tbsp Chinkiang vinegar
- 1 Tbsp finely sliced scallions
- 1/2 tsp grated fresh ginger
- 2 tsp sugar

### Cooking
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- salt for seasoning


## Instructions

#### Dough

Drizzle about 3/4 of the water into the flour while stirring. If the dough does not fully incorporate, drizzle in more water a tablespoon at a time until it just comes together.

Transfer to a floured surface and knead into a smooth ball.

Cover and rest for 30m at room temperature, or up to overnight in the fridge.

#### Pancake formation

Lightly flour a work surface. Divide dough in four pieces.

Roll dough ball into an 8" disk. Brush a very thin layer of sesame oil over the dough. Roll disk up and then twist it into a spiral. Flatten with hand and re-roll into an 8" disk.

Brush with another thin layer of sesame oil. Sprinkle with a loose handful of scallions. Roll and twist again as before.

Re-roll into a disk about the thickness of a chopstick.

#### Cook

Make the sauce.

Heat oil in a pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Salt pancakes on each side. Fry each side until golden brown, being careful not to splash hot oil.

Transfer to paper towel lined plate. Cut into wedges and serve.
