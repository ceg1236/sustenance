# Scallion pancakes

Adapted from [The Food Lab](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/04/extra-flaky-scallion-pancakes-recipe.html) and [Omnivore's Cookbook](https://omnivorescookbook.com/chinese-scallion-pancakes/).

Makes 6 pancakes.

### Heuristics

[The Food Lab](https://www.seriouseats.com/2011/04/the-food-lab-how-to-make-scallion-pancakes-chinese-appetizers.html): Doughs made with cold water (most western breads/pastries) have more gluten formation and elasticity. Hot water doughs (often found in Chinese food) have denatured proteins. This prevents structure formation and leads to tender dough with little elasticity.

## Ingredients

### Dough
- 2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting work surface
- 1 cup boiling water
- 1/4 cup cold water
- 4 thinly sliced scallions (added at the end)

### Paste for dough
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup sesame oil
- 1 tsp coarse salt
- (optional) 1/2 to 1 tsp ground Sichuan peppercorns

### Dipping sauce
- 2 Tbsp soy sauce
- 2 Tbsp Chinkiang or rice vinegar
- pinch of red pepper flakes
- drizzle of sesame oil
- 1 tsp grated or minced fresh ginger
- 2 tsp brown sugar

## Instructions

#### Dough

Drizzle the hot water into the flour while stirring. If not fully incorporated, drizzle in the cold water a spoonful at the time. Dough should end up a bit sticky, as we will be adding more flour later.

Transfer to a floured surface and knead into a smooth ball.

Cover and rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

#### Pancake formation

Mix the paste.

Lightly flour a work surface. Divide dough in six pieces.

Roll out ball into a 12-18" long strip. Spread a thin layer of paste over it. Roll up the strip on the long axis into a rope and then coil it up into a spiral.

Repeat the process once, but this time also add a loose handful of scallions before rolling it up. Flatten out into a disk about the thickness of a chopstick.

#### Cook

Make the sauce.

Heat 1 Tbsp vegetable oil in a pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Fry each pancake side until golden brown, being careful not to splash the hot oil.

Transfer to paper towel lined plate. Cut into wedges and serve.
