# [chunky granola with almond flour](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/maple-almond-granola-clusters-vegan/)

why is store granola $15/lb and so sweet?? make your own for $3/lb thanks
changes from original recipe: halved the sugar, swapped out syrup for honey

## ingredients
- 3 cups rolled oats
- 3/4 cup almond flour/meal
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 3/4 c chopped unsalted almonds
- 1/3 c coconut oil
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/6 cup packed dark brown sugar
- 1/6 cup honey

## methodology
- mix dry, whisk sugar/oil/liquids over medium heat, combine
- press everything into even layer on parchment-paper-lined pan
- bake at 300F, 40 minutes, rotate every 10

## notes 12/2/24
- about 50% chunks. bit crumbly. probably because I halved the sugar
- try almond butter and more coconut oil next time to increase binding
- try adding flax, goji, cashews for fun
