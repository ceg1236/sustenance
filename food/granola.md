# [chunky granola with almond flour](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/maple-almond-granola-clusters-vegan/)

why is store granola so sweet and so expensive?? make your own for $3/lb thanks

changes from original recipe: halved the sugar, swapped out syrup/sugar for honey, added flax seeds

this fills about 2 quart jars, which is roughly a week's supply of granola for me.

## ingredients
- 3 cups rolled oats
- 3/4 cup almond flour/meal
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 3/4 c chopped unsalted nuts (I use cashews)
- 1/4 cup flax seeds
- 1/3 c coconut oil
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/3 cup honey (or whatever sticky thing you prefer)

## methodology
- mix dry, whisk sugar/oil/liquids over medium heat, combine
- press everything into even layer on parchment-paper-lined pan
- bake at 300F, 40 minutes, rotate midway
