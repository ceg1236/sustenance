# Ingredients
- 1 block firm tofu, ½ block soft tofu – this creates a mixed texture
- 3 tbs nutritional yeast – very useful vegan savory, “cheesy” topping
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp Kala Namak (aka Indian black salt), optional  
  *Gives that “eggy” sulfur flavor*
- 1 tbs vegan butter for pan

# Process
1. Combine firm + soft tofu in a mixing bowl. Mix to leave some chunks but mostly broken down. Add the spices and seasonings, mix well.
2. Grease pan. Add tofu, spread evenly. Leave it in place for ~5 mins to allow the tofu to get slightly crispy.
3. Flip the whole scramble section by section to allow the other side to cook up.
4. Cook to your desired level of crispy vs soft.  
   *Tofu can be eaten straight from the package, so there’s no risk of “undercooking” it.*
