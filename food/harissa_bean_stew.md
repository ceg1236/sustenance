# Harissa white bean stew

Spicy & colorful bean stew, adapted from [NY Times recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020754-spicy-white-bean-stew-with-broccoli-rabe). Vegan except for the optional crumbled cheese topping. If you want it completely vegan, Trader Joe's has a great vegan feta.

TODO: modify for starting from dehydrated beans

## Ingredients (6-8 servings)

- 1-1/2 cup olive oil
- 8 garlic cloves
- 2 medium onions (red or yellow)
- 6 tablespoons harissa

- 90oz hydrated white beans (or 6x 15oz cans)
- 4-5 cups broth (I like Better Than Bouillon's "No Chicken" base)
- 2 large bunches kale or broccoli rabe
- salt & black pepper

- 2 preserved lemons & some of their brine
- 1 fresh lemon worth of juice

Toppings
- 1 bunch parsley or cilantro
- 4oz salty cheese, such as feta, vegan feta, queso fresco, cotija, etc.

## Instructions

### Prep (interleave w/ cooking steps as needed)
- Thinly slice the garlic & onions.
- Drain & rinse the beans.
- Veggies: Dice up the stems into small pieces and reserve them in a separate bowl. Tear or chop the leaves into bite-size pieces.
- Thinly slice the preserved lemons.
- Finely chop the parsley/cilantro and crumble the cheese for topping.

### Cook
1. Heat 1-1/2 cups olive oil in large pot over medium heat. Add garlic and onion. Cook until lightly browned, ~5 minutes.
2. Stir in the harissa and cook ~2 minutes until the oil is a vibrant orange color.
3. Add beans. Lightly crush some of the beans.
4. Stir in the broth and veggie stems. Re-season as needed. Simmer until you've reached your desired consistency, 15-25 minutes.
5. Stir in the veggie leaves, preserved lemon, and fresh lemon juice. Cook just a bit until the leaves are how you like them.
6. Season with salt & pepper to taste.
7. Serve with parsley and feta.
