# Harissa white bean stew

Spicy & colorful bean stew, adapted from [NY Times recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020754-spicy-white-bean-stew-with-broccoli-rabe). 

Vegan except for the optional crumbled cheese topping. If you want it completely vegan, Trader Joe's has a great vegan feta. I use Better Than Bouillon No-Chicken base to make the broth.

TODO: modify for starting from dehydrated beans
