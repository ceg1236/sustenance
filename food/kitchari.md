Really nourishing stew that's good for winter, sickness, or digestive troubles. Yummy for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

## Ingredients (serves 6-8)
- 2 cups split lentils (I prefer red)
- 1 cup basmati rice
- 1/2 cup mung beans
- a couple thumb-sized pieces of ginger
- 1-2 tsp **each** of: fenugreek, cumin, fennel seed, coriander seed
- you can add any other warming or chai-type spices you like, such as cardamom or garam masala
- coconut oil for cooking
- 8 cups broth

## Cook
- Rinse & drain the grains/legumes until the water runs clear.
- Splop a few spoonfuls of coconut oil in a Dutch oven or stockpot, and heat up all the spices until lightly browned and fragrant.
- Coat the grains/legumes in the oily spice blend. Add the broth. Simmer and stir periodically until liquid is absorbed, about 25-30 minutes.
- Optionally, you can add chopped greens while there's still liquid in the pot.
- Salt to taste if needed.

Also makes a good instant pot meal.
