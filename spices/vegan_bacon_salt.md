It turns out that the taste of bacon can be nearly simulated with smoke, paprika, and brown sugar.

Adapted from [this recipe](https://www.food.com/recipe/homemade-smoky-veggie-bacon-salt-508965).

- 1/3 cup alderwood smoked sea salt
- 2 Tbsp fresh hot smoked paprika
- 1 Tbsp fresh sweet smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper

(if I remember to do this -- less critical)
- 1/2 Tbsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1/2 tsp mustard powder

Mix these in a pint jar, then add any kind of brown sugar to taste.

I usually do almost 3/4 cup of turbinado sugar, which is extremely coarse grained, so if you are using fine sugar, start with much less. My goal isn't to make it taste sweet but just to get it to the point where the other spices don't overwhelm your food.

### Notes

In my experience, standard supermarket paprika (labeled simply "paprika") in the U.S. tastes almost flavorless, possibly because it's been sitting on a shelf for a long time. Serious Eats has a [detailed paprika rant here](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-make-chicken-paprikash-the-food-lab). Reportedly, paprika degrades in flavor over time a lot faster than your typical common spice.

There are a lot of different kinds of paprika, but according to Serious Eats, the most important thing is just whether your paprika is fresh or not.
