+ [pain_lancienne.md](pain_lancienne.md) - Delayed fermentation bread, or pain l'ancienne. Extremely low-effort bread, no dough babysitting time. Very bready tasting, not sour. 15 min active work.
+ [sourdough_tartine.md](sourdough_tartine.md) - Tartine style sourdough. Not too sour, tender and holey crumb but not too holey, crunchy crust. Requires a solid day of babysitting (about 8 hrs on/off) and then the next morning (~1.5 hrs).
+ [ny_sourdough_bagels.md](ny_sourdough_bagels.md) - adaptation of Peter Reinhart's NY-style sourdough bagels

## my tools
*sorted in roughly decreasing order of necessity*

+ bread knife
+ 500F-capable oven
+ wide mixing bowl
+ kitchen scale with tare function
+ reusable bowl wrap (I have a Bee's Wrap, but it isn't remotely airtight, so I just clove hitch it down with a piece of paracord)
+ bench scraper
+ parchment paper
+ Dutch oven
+ flour sack towels
+ pyrex measuring cup

I'm used to fudging water temperatures from brewing tea all the time, so I don't usually use a thermometer. For example, if I want 110F water for my yeast, I'll do about 40% boiling water + 60% fridge water, i.e. `(212*0.4) + (50*0.6) ~= 115`, and assume I've lost a few degrees by transference into a room temperature container.
