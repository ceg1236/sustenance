+ [pain_lancienne.md](pain_lancienne.md) - Delayed fermentation bread, or pain l'ancienne. Instant yeast based. Extremely low-effort bread, no dough babysitting time. Very bready tasting, not sour. 15 min active work (5 min mixing, 2-3 days waiting, 10 min shaping on bake day).
+ [sourdough_tartine.md](sourdough_tartine.md) - Tartine style sourdough. Not too sour, tender and holey crumb but not too holey, crunchy crust, very beautiful when done correctly. Requires a solid day of babysitting (about 8 hrs on/off) and then the next morning (~1.5 hrs).
+ [ny_sourdough_bagels.md](ny_sourdough_bagels.md) - adaptation of Peter Reinhart's NY-style sourdough bagels to work with less fridge space
+ [sourdough_ciabatta.md](sourdough_ciabatta.md) - A quick ferment using both sourdough starter and instant yeast. Not particularly sour, has a mild yet rich flavor. Extremely moist and holey with fantastic rise. Crust is rather soft. Only a little more work than pain l'ancienne. 5 min active work, 1-2 hrs babysitting every half hour, overnight wait, then 10 min of work on baking day.

## my tools
*relatively necessary*

+ bread knife
+ 500F-capable oven
+ wide mixing bowl
+ kitchen scale with tare function
+ bench scraper

*useful, but can be improvised from other common kitchen implements*

+ reusable bowl wrap (I have a Bee's Wrap, which isn't remotely airtight, so I just tie it down with a piece of paracord)
+ parchment paper (can also use cornmeal/semolina/grease)
+ Dutch oven (can also use combo cooker or upside-down oven-safe pot)
+ floursack towels for proofing
+ cooling rack
+ probe thermometer

I'm used to fudging water temperatures from brewing tea all the time, so I don't usually use a thermometer. For example, if I want 110F water for my yeast, I'll do about 40% boiling water + 60% fridge water, i.e. `(212*0.4) + (50*0.6) ~= 115`, and assume I've lost a few degrees by transference into a room temperature container.
