+ [pain_lancienne.md](pain_lancienne.md) - Delayed fermentation bread, or pain l'ancienne. Instant yeast based. Extremely low-effort bread, no dough babysitting time. Very bready tasting, not sour. 15 min active work (5 min mixing, 2-3 days waiting, 10 min shaping on bake day).
+ [sourdough_ciabatta.md](sourdough_ciabatta.md) - I call my variant "Fool's Ciabatta". A super-high-hydration quick ferment using both sourdough starter and instant yeast. Extremely moist and holey with fantastic rise and a mild yet rich flavor. Soft but browned crust. Only a little more work than pain l'ancienne. 5 min active work, 1-2 hrs of babysitting every half hour, overnight wait, then 10 min of work on baking day.
+ [sourdough_tartine.md](sourdough_tartine.md) - Tartine-style sourdough. Not too sour, tender and holey crumb but not too holey, crunchy crust, very beautiful when done correctly. Tasty but effortful; requires a solid day of babysitting (about 8 hrs on/off) and then the next morning (~1.5 hrs).
+ [ny_sourdough_bagels.md](ny_sourdough_bagels.md) - adaptation of Peter Reinhart's NY-style sourdough bagels to work with less fridge space
+ [flatbread.md](flatbread.md) - Quick and simple flatbread mountain party pile for those who crave flatbread.

## use cases
- Want to quickly produce a very large volume of inexpensive and delicious calories for a potluck/picnic? Make high-hydration ciabatta or pain l'ancienne.
- Want to punish yourself while simultaneously deepening your understanding of bread chemistry and perfecting your mastery over bread variables? Try Tartine-style sourdough.
- Want to do an interactive bread activity with friends? Try flatbread mountain (quick & super easy), soft pretzels (medium speed & ease), or sourdough bagels (prep required).

## my tools
*relatively necessary*

+ bread knife
+ 500F-capable oven
+ baking sheets
+ large, wide vessel for mixing dough (I either use a wide metal mixing bowl or a clear 8-quart tub, both from the restaurant supply store)
+ kitchen scale with tare function
+ bench scraper

*useful, but can be improvised from other common kitchen implements*

+ reusable bowl wrap (I have a Bee's Wrap, which isn't remotely airtight, so I just tie it down with a piece of paracord)
+ parchment paper (can also use cornmeal/semolina/grease)
+ Dutch oven (can also use combo cooker or upside-down oven-safe pot)
+ shaped proofing vessel (floursack towels + mixing bowl, or banneton, etc)
+ cooling rack
+ probe thermometer

I'm used to fudging water temperatures from brewing tea all the time, so I don't usually use a thermometer. For example, if I want 110F water for my yeast, I'll do about 40% boiling water + 60% fridge water, i.e. `(212*0.4) + (50*0.6) ~= 115`, and assume I've lost a few degrees by transference into a room temperature container.
