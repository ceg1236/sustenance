# Soft pretzels

Gratification level: High. It takes about an hour between thinking about pretzels and having pretzels in your mouth.

I haven't deviated substantially from recipes yet.

- The dough lacks flavor when only proofed 10 minutes. But it gets hard to handle if proofed longer. Still trying to find the balance.
- Better when topped with butter. But when I tried adding more butter directly to the recipe, the dough got floppy and hard to handle.
- I used half the recommended amount of baking soda for the bath and it was fine.
