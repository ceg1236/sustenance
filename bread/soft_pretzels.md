# Soft pretzels

Gratification level: High. It takes about an hour between thinking about pretzels and having pretzels in your mouth.

I haven't deviated substantially from recipes yet. summarizing here for quick ref so I don't have to scroll through 50 pages of article on a phone while baking.

- The dough lacks flavor when only proofed 10 minutes. But it gets hard to handle if proofed longer. Still trying to find the balance.
- Better when topped with butter. But when I tried adding more butter directly to the recipe, the dough got floppy and hard to handle.
- I used half the recommended amount of baking soda for the bath and it was fine.

### ingredients
- 360 mL lukewarm water
- 7g (2-1/4 tsp) instant yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 Tbsp brown sugar
- 1 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted
- 470-500g flour

### instructions
- whisk yeast into warm water and let sit for a minute
- whisk in salt, sugar, melted butter
- incrementally mix in 3 cups of the flour
- incrementally add more of the flour until the dough is no longer sticky. if you poke it with your finger, it should bounce back.
- knead it until dough is soft, slightly tacky, and passes the windowpane test. about 5 minutes.
- cover lightly with a towel and rest 10 minutes
- start the baking soda bath. ~1/4 cup baking soda in 2 quarts water
- preheat oven 400F. line baking sheets and lightly grease/spray
- cut dough into 12 equal pieces
- roll dough into a 20-22 inch long rope. twist into pretzel shape (see original recipe)
- boil shaped pretzels in the baking soda bath for 20-30 seconds each. sprinkle tops with very coarse sea salt.
- bake at 400F for 12-15 min or until golden brown
- serve with spicy nacho sauce
