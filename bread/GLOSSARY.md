[**Baker's percentage**](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/pro/reference/bakers-percentage): Does not add up to 100%. The total flour weight is expressed as 100%, and all other ingredient weights expressed as a percentage of the total flour weight. So a "50% hydration" dough means that there is 50% as much water as flour, or 1/3 of the flour+water weight.

**Float test**: Test for sufficient yeast activity in a ferment. Scoop up a bit and drop it in water. If it floats, it's ready to use.

[**Kneading**](https://www.thespruceeats.com/kneading-dough-bread-baking-for-beginners-427562): In this particular context, mixing the dough to increase gluten development, which will provide the structure needed to create holey bread that holds its shape and is capable of rising well. The goal of kneading is to align the gluten strands by stretching the dough over and over again.

**Proofing**: A final fermentation step between shaping and baking, in which the dough is leavened to its pre-baking size.

**Starter**: A live culture of wild yeast used to leaven sourdough bread.

**Windowpane test**: Test for sufficient gluten development. If a piece of the dough can be stretched to a paper-thin, translucent membrane, the gluten formation is sufficient. (It's hard to *over*knead dough.)

## Notes on ingredients

### Flour

All-purpose flour only has 10-12% gluten. If possible, use bread flour (12-14% gluten), or if appropriate, high-gluten flour (14-16%).

It is possible to make a great-tasting bread with all-purpose flour, but difficult to achieve an artisanal bread texture. Gluten is necessary to get holey bread with a good rise.

If substituting, note that whole-wheat flour requires slightly more hydration than white flour.

### Water

Filtered water is preferable to tap water when you're feeding your starter. However, as long as your tap water is drinkable, a sourdough starter should be able to survive on it.

For your dough it doesn't make a notable difference, unless your tap water is particularly bad.
