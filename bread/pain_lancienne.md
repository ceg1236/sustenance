pain l'ancienne (delayed fermentation bread)
-----

# Overview

**Optimizes for** active time, prep time, and ease. Highly bready but not sour.

This is the lowest-effort very-bready-tasting bread I've ever made. You only need to do 5 min of active work before the proofing step and before the baking step, so you can actually leave the house and do something else while the dough is rising, unlike with more needy rustic breads.

## Explanation

tl;dr is that this method increases breakdown of complex carbohydrates while keeping yeast inactive longer, increasing eventual availability of sugars for the Maillard reaction (enzymatic browning).

I've written [a detailed visual presentation here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rHwvIju0Y6v59li60ozArehN2Ak4jTAfD6dlT3CjaIU/edit?usp=sharing) about the science of delayed-fermentation bread.

## Gratification delay

| Thinking about bread to having bread in your mouth | 2-3 days |
| Taking dough out of fridge to having bread in your mouth | 3-6 hours |

## Effort

+ 5 min initial mixing
+ 5 min shaping before rise
  + (2-6 hour rise, dependent on room temperature)
+ 5 min work before baking
  + (30 min bake+cool time)

# Ingredients

**Note about temperature**: Reinhardt recommends ice cold (40F) water and getting the dough immediately into the fridge with minimal heat transfer. I found that when I aggressively prioritized this, bread flavor was wondrously maximized (95th percentile) at cost of suboptimal (20th percentile) crumb texture, possibly due to the lack of dough malleability. This may be mitigated if you use an electric mixer; I go by hand.

I usually just use cold tap water and it's fine.

+ 27 oz bread flour
+ 2-1/4 tsp (0.56 oz) salt
  + (I double if using very coarse salt due to packing suboptimality)
+ 1-3/4 tsp (0.19 oz) instant yeast
+ just under 2-1/4 cups cold water

## Halved
I halve the recipe a lot for personal consumption
+ 13.5 oz bread flour
+ 1-1/8 tsp salt
+ 1 tsp instant yeast
+ 1-1/8 cups cold water

# Methodology

## Dough setup

**Total time**: 5-10 min

**Heuristics**
+ Spend no more time mixing the dough than necessary; your goal is for it to stay cold and not absorb too much heat from your hands or the room temperature.
+ Desired dough consistency: still a bit sticky, but easily releases from the sides of the bowl and from your hands.
+ The dough will rise a bit more than double, so pick a bowl 2-3x deeper than your start ingredients take up.

Mix the dry ingredients thoroughly in a large bowl. Mix in the water. I use a fork to avoid heat transfer as long as I can.

**Debugging**
+ If dough is *fully incorporated* but too sticky, add flour. Make a mental note to decrease your starting amount of water next time.
+ If dough refuses to fully incorporate, dribble in only a spoonful of water at a time and quickly re-incorporate until the consistency is correct. It is very easy to add too much water, so be cautious.

Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2-5 days. I prefer 3-4 days.
+ The flavor is just starting to become bready at 2 days.
+ After 5 days, it might overferment and start to have a weird consistency. Additionally, if your plastic wrap is not airtight, the dough tends to dry around the edges.

## Proofing

**Total time**: 2.5-6 hours
**Active time**: 5 min

On the day you want to make the bread, take it out of the fridge and let it rise (still covered) somewhere warm until it has doubled in size.

If it's particularly cold in your house, this may take 6 hours. At a comfortable room temperature, I find this takes around 2-4 hours.

## Baking

**Total time**: 30 min
**Active time**: 5 min

1. **Preheat** oven to 500F. Add a steam pan (any ovenable vessel containing at least a cup of water) to humidify the oven.

1. Steam serves several purposes:
  + delays crust formation, allowing for greater dough expansion
  + gelatinizes more starch at the surface
  + increases surface heat transfer and therefore exterior crispiness without negatively impacting the soft interior

1. **Shaping**: Liberally sprinkle a clean surface (counter, board, etc) with flour. Gently transfer dough to the floured surface, trying not to de-gas it. Dip your dry hands in flour. Gently stretch the dough into a rectangle while coating it in flour.

1. Cut into strips.
  + I prefer 3-4 pieces, which yield loaves about the size of a forearm, which is a nice ratio of crispy crust to soft crumb for dipping and buttering.
  + Reinhardt recommends 6 pieces, which yields thin baguettes that are mostly crust.

1. Prep two sheet pans with baking parchment or spray oil. Transfer the dough to them and gently elongate the strips to the length of the pan. Diagonally score the tops several times with a knife. I score pretty deep; about halfway into the depth of the dough. This allows the bread to expand instead of becoming domed, while maximizing the crusty surface. Also it looks cool.

1. Slide into oven and set temperature down to 475F.

1. Set a loud timer. After 8 minutes, rotate the pan.

1. Bake until the crust is a rich and delectable looking golden brown. This will take 10-15 more minutes.

1. Let cool for ~10 minutes.

## Serve

I like to mix a plate of olive oil, salt, pepper, and a dash of balsamic vinegar.

Will feed 4-5 ravenous bread-fiends, or 10+ casual bread nibblers.
