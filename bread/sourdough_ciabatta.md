# High-hydration sourdough ciabatta

Work in progress.
I am optimizing for: super moist tender crumb with big holes, some sourdoughy bready flavor, 
but overall relatively mild and creamy.

Very loosely adapted from [Jason's Quick Cocodrillo Ciabatta](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/2984/jasons-quick-coccodrillo-ciabatta-bread), 
with additional tips in [this comment](http://www.thefreshloaf.com//node/3088/bluezebras-baking-banter#comment-14086). My changes:
- Added sourdough starter
- No mixer used.
- Lowered to 90% hydration to make it easier. Original recipe is a whopping 95% hydration.
- No longer a same-day bread. I added an overnight fermentation.

### Tips

- Using a Dutch oven for the first half of the bake produces a much more aesthetic golden crust than simply baking with a steam pan, and a better rise. Otherwise, I don't think it changed the flavor/texture substantially.
- SOPPING WET HANDS ARE YOUR ONLY DEFENSE AGAINST THE SUPERGLUE THAT IS HIGH HYDRATION DOUGH. RE-WET YOUR HANDS & SCRAPER LIKE YOUR SANITY DEPENDS ON IT (WHICH IT DOES).
- If you plan to deal with more than 1 or 2 loaves, you might want a couche to keep them separated during final bench rise. The dough is really gloopy and the pieces ooze into each other easily.

### Iteration notes

- I did a round with starter that had been in the fridge for a day and it rose substantially less.
- I did a round where I held back 1/10 of the water and added it gradually while strengthening the gluten, in hopes this would make it easier to handle. It helped a little but I don't think it wasÂ worth the extra effort for me.

## Process

### Ingredients

*90% hydration dough*
- 500g white bread flour
- 450g water, lukewarm (~110F)
- 20g active sourdough starter
- 2 tsp instant yeast
- 15g salt

### First day

Dissolve the starter and yeast in the water. Sift the salt into the flour. Combine.
Stir until the dough comes together and gluten strands develop, about 15-20 minutes. 

Perform 3 stretch & folds at 30-45m intervals to build more tension.

Fridge overnight (8-12 hours) or until dough has tripled.

### Second day

Get a bowl of water to dip your hands in. You will need continuously wet hands and a wet bench scraper to get anywhere near this dough without pulling off chunks.

Turn out dough onto a well floured surface. Split the dough into 2-4 pieces.

It's not originally recommended at this stage, but I do a couple more stretch & fold rounds at 30-45m intervals.

When it's starting to look poofy (probably within 1-2 hours), preheat the oven to 500F. Line a pan, or ideally a Dutch oven / combo cooker, with parchment. If you don't have a closed baking vessel, steam the oven too. (I do this by adding an oven safe dish containing a couple cups of water.)

Gently stretch dough piece(s) you are about to bake into an oblong rectangle shape and quickly flip upside down onto the parchment.

Slide pan into oven and lower heat to 475F. 
Bake until golden brown or 205F in the center (15-25 minutes depending on size), rotating halfway through. If you're using a Dutch oven, also remove the lid at the halfway point.

Let cool for 20+ minutes.

### Results

This was pretty darn good. Very very moist. Fantastic rise with really holey structure.
