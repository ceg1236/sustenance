# High-hydration sourdough ciabatta / "Fool's Ciabatta" / Super Gloop

**What I'm optimizing for**: super moist tender crumb with big holes, some sourdoughy bready flavor, but overall relatively mild and creamy. Also, low-effort, if you can believe it.

This ciabatta tends to develop a rich flavor that tastes almost eggy.

Very loosely adapted from [Jason's Quick Cocodrillo Ciabatta](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/2984/jasons-quick-coccodrillo-ciabatta-bread), 
with additional tips in [this comment](http://www.thefreshloaf.com//node/3088/bluezebras-baking-banter#comment-14086). My changes:
- Added sourdough starter
- No mixer used. I use spaced stretch-n'-folds for gluten development instead for convenience (and to avoid overmixing).
- I prefer overnight fridge fermentation for flavor if there's fridge space

"Fool's Ciabatta" is when I skip the final bench rise (post-fridge proofing step). Honestly I don't notice much difference in flavor, and it saves a lot of energy to not deal with this step.

### Tips

- Hydration level: If you are new to high-hydration bread, I recommend practicing at 90% until you are comfortable before moving to 95%. I prefer 97% now. I have gone to 100% a couple times as an experiment to challenge the bread gods and was punished for my hubris each time.
- Floured hands are not effective against dough this wet. SOPPING WET HANDS ARE YOUR ONLY DEFENSE AGAINST THE SUPERGLUE THAT IS HIGH HYDRATION DOUGH. RE-WET YOUR HANDS & SCRAPER ON EVERY SINGLE DOUGH TOUCH LIKE YOUR SANITY DEPENDS ON IT (WHICH IT DOES). If you do not wet your hands enough, you will have giant sticky dough mitts for hands and it will take forever to scrape off.
- Using a Dutch oven for the first half of the bake produces a much more aesthetic golden crust than simply baking with a steam pan, and a better rise. Otherwise, I don't think it changed the flavor/texture substantially.
- I don't have enough dough prep space or cat-safe surfaces to do the final bench rise. It's nearly impossible to keep the dough pieces separated unless you space them far apart, which would also require a lot of bowls and containers to cover the dough in. The dough is legendarily gloopy and nearby pieces will merge with each other easily.

## Process

Note: The dough will triple in size during initial stretch-n-folds. You will need at least a 4-quart container for the 500g recipe. I usually do a double batch in an 8-quart clear tub from the restaurant supply store. It rises from 2 quarts initially to a bit over the 6 quart line at max rise.

### Ingredients for 97% hydration ciabatta

| **Ingredient** | **Standard** (feeds a few) | **Doubled** (feeds a party) |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| white high-gluten bread flour | 500g | 1000g |
| lukewarm water (90-110F) | 485g | 970g |
| instant yeast | 2 tsp | 4 tsp |
| salt | 15g (about 1 Tbsp kosher) | 30g |
| optional: active sourdough starter | 20g | 40g |

### Dough development

Dissolve the starter and yeast in the water. Sift the salt into the flour. Combine.
Stir until the dough comes together and some gluten strands develop.

Get a bowl of water to dip your hands in. You will need continuously wet hands and a wet bench scraper to get anywhere near this dough without turning your hands into sticky dough balls. I dip my hands between each time I touch the dough.

Perform 3 stretch & folds to build more tension. You don't need to develop this stuff until it's perfectly round like country bread, it just needs to be coherent and not tear when you stretch it. 

Set stretch&fold intervals so that the dough doubles in volume by the first round and triples in volume by the second round. For me this is about 1hr per stretch&fold in a 70-75F kitchen. It should be tripling in volume by the end if your kitchen is warm. If the kitchen is not warm enough, I make a little dough-sized steam room by putting in cups of boiling water and inverting a big tub/bowl over the entire affair.

If there is room in the fridge, cover and store in the fridge for ideally 18 hours to develop additional flavor. No less than 8 hours. No more than 24 hours.
If there is not room in the fridge ;( Give it more final proofing time.

Turn out dough onto a LARGE well floured surface (THE GLOOP WILL SPREAD). Split the dough into 1-3 pieces if using the 500g recipe, or 2-6 pieces if using the 1000g recipe.
- Fewer loaves: this will make long, large loaves that are good for slicing and dipping to share with a group of friends.
- More loaves: this will make more traditionally sized loaves that are great for a large sandwich.

OPTIONAL: If you choose to counter proof the shaped dough for 1-2 more hours, cover it with something that won't stick to it, like mixing bowls. I prefer to skip this final proofing step for convenience because the gloop gets EVERYWHERE.

### Prep
Preheat the oven to 500F. 

Line your baking sheet(s), or ideally a Dutch oven / combo cooker, with parchment. Sprinkle with semolina or cornmeal.

If you are not using a closed baking vessel, pre-steam the oven. (I do this by adding an oven-safe dish containing a couple cups of boiling water.)

### Baking
Gently stretch dough piece(s) you are about to bake into an oblong rectangle shape and quickly flip upside down onto the parchment. "Velvet glove, iron fist."

Dust the tops lightly with flour. I find it easiest to shake flour through a fine mesh strainer.

Slide pan into oven and lower heat to 475F.

Bake until golden brown (probably 15-25 minutes depending on how you sized your pieces), rotating mid-bake. If you're using a Dutch oven, also remove the lid at the halfway point.

Let cool for 10+ minutes.

### Results

Very very moist. Fantastic rise with really holey structure. A crowd pleaser.

Note that the holes will be too big to hold toppings if you cut the bread in slices. This bread is designed to be cut in half flat for use as sandwich bread, where the holes can hold lots of stuff but are blocked off by the crust.

### Iteration notes

- I did a round where I held back 1/10 of the water and added it gradually while strengthening the gluten, in hopes this would make it easier to handle. It helped a little but it was not worth the extra effort for me.
- The 18hr fridge rise makes the final counter proof unnecessary for me in terms of flavor.

# Variants

- One of my housemates did a variant he calls "Simpleton's Ciabatta", where you do fewer stretch-n-fold steps, proof for less time, throw the entire dough on one baking tray, and skip the oven steaming step.
- Basically you can skip quite a lot of steps and still end up with reasonable tasting fresh bread, even if it gets less artisanal in the process.
