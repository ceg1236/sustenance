# High-hydration sourdough ciabatta

**What I'm optimizing for**: super moist tender crumb with big holes, some sourdoughy bready flavor, 
but overall relatively mild and creamy.

Very loosely adapted from [Jason's Quick Cocodrillo Ciabatta](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/2984/jasons-quick-coccodrillo-ciabatta-bread), 
with additional tips in [this comment](http://www.thefreshloaf.com//node/3088/bluezebras-baking-banter#comment-14086). My changes:
- Added sourdough starter
- No mixer used. I use spaced stretch-n'-folds for gluten development instead.
- No longer a same-day bread. I added an overnight fermentation.

### Tips

- Using a Dutch oven for the first half of the bake produces a much more aesthetic golden crust than simply baking with a steam pan, and a better rise. Otherwise, I don't think it changed the flavor/texture substantially.
- SOPPING WET HANDS ARE YOUR ONLY DEFENSE AGAINST THE SUPERGLUE THAT IS HIGH HYDRATION DOUGH. RE-WET YOUR HANDS & SCRAPER LIKE YOUR SANITY DEPENDS ON IT (WHICH IT DOES).
- Wet hands and floured hands are defense tactics that CANNOT BE USED SIMULTANEOUSLY. Floured hands are also not very effective against 95% hydration dough. I only use floured hands at the very end, for final shaping.
- If you own a couche, definitely use it to keep multiple loaves separated during final bench rise. The dough is really gloopy and the pieces ooze into each other easily. (I don't have a couche, and I have tried building moats out of utensils or lines of flour, but more often than not the dough simply devours them.)


## Process

### Ingredients

*95% hydration dough*
- 500g white bread flour
- 475g water, lukewarm (~110F)
- 20g active sourdough starter
- 2 tsp instant yeast
- 15g salt

### First day

Dissolve the starter and yeast in the water. Sift the salt into the flour. Combine.
Stir until the dough comes together and gluten strands develop, about 15-20 minutes. 

Get a bowl of water to dip your hands in. You will need continuously wet hands and a wet bench scraper to get anywhere near this dough without turning your hands into sticky dough balls. I tend to dip my hands between each time I touch the dough.

Perform 3 stretch & folds at 30-45m intervals to build more tension.

Fridge overnight (8-12 hours) or until dough has tripled.

### Second day

Turn out dough onto a well floured surface. Split the dough into 2-4 pieces. Cover.

### Prep
When the dough is starting to poof up a bit (probably within 1-2 hours, depending on ambient temp), preheat the oven to 500F. 

Line a pan, or ideally a Dutch oven / combo cooker, with parchment. Sprinkle with semolina or cornmeal.

If you are not using a closed baking vessel, pre-steam the oven. (I do this by adding an oven-safe dish containing a couple cups of water.)

### Baking
Gently stretch dough piece(s) you are about to bake into an oblong rectangle shape and quickly flip upside down onto the parchment. Dust the tops with flour.

Slide pan into oven and lower heat to 475F.

Bake until golden brown (15-25 minutes depending on how small you made your pieces), rotating mid-bake. If you're using a Dutch oven, also remove the lid at the halfway point.

Let cool for 10+ minutes.

### Results

This was pretty darn good. Very very moist. Fantastic rise with really holey structure.

This ciabatta often develops a rich flavor that tastes almost eggy.

### Iteration notes

- I did a round with starter that had been in the fridge for a day and it rose substantially less.
- I did a round where I held back 1/10 of the water and added it gradually while strengthening the gluten, in hopes this would make it easier to handle. It helped a little but I don't think it wasÂ worth the extra effort for me.

# Variants

I've been tweaking this bread to fit my schedule and personal tastes rather than cleaving true tothe original bread.

## "Moon bread" / "Fool's ciabatta"

The lazy version.

Same ingredients. Procedural changes:
- don't bother with the post-fridge rise
- don't bother splitting the dough; toss the whole thing on one tray
- fridge proof anywhere between 8 and 24 hours

The bread will be much more poofy and round if you fridge proof for 24 hours. Not suitable for use as sandwich bread (as it rises too tall, and if you use slices, toppings will fall right through the holes). Great for snacking.
