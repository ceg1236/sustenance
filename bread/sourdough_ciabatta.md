# High-hydration sourdough ciabatta / "Fool's Ciabatta"

**What I'm optimizing for**: super moist tender crumb with big holes, some sourdoughy bready flavor, but overall relatively mild and creamy. Also, low-effort, if you can believe it.

This ciabatta tends to develop a rich flavor that tastes almost eggy.

Very loosely adapted from [Jason's Quick Cocodrillo Ciabatta](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/2984/jasons-quick-coccodrillo-ciabatta-bread), 
with additional tips in [this comment](http://www.thefreshloaf.com//node/3088/bluezebras-baking-banter#comment-14086). My changes:
- Added sourdough starter
- No mixer used. I use spaced stretch-n'-folds for gluten development instead for convenience (and to avoid overmixing).
- No longer a same-day bread. I added an overnight fermentation for scheduling convenience.

"Fool's Ciabatta" is when I skip the final bench rise (post-fridge proofing step). Honestly I don't notice much difference in flavor, and it saves a lot of energy to not deal with this step.

### Tips

- Hydration level: If you are new to high-hydration bread, I recommend practicing at 90% until you are comfortable before moving to 95%. I typically do 97% now. I have gone to 100% as a test and found it too hard to handle.
- SOPPING WET HANDS ARE YOUR ONLY DEFENSE AGAINST THE SUPERGLUE THAT IS HIGH HYDRATION DOUGH. RE-WET YOUR HANDS & SCRAPER LIKE YOUR SANITY DEPENDS ON IT (WHICH IT DOES).
- Floured hands are not effective against dough this wet.
- Using a Dutch oven for the first half of the bake produces a much more aesthetic golden crust than simply baking with a steam pan, and a better rise. Otherwise, I don't think it changed the flavor/texture substantially.
- I don't have enough dough prep space or cat-safe surfaces to do the final bench rise. It's nearly impossible to keep the dough pieces separated unless you space them far apart, which would also require a lot of bowls and containers to cover the dough in. The dough is legendarily gloopy and nearby pieces will merge with each other easily.

## Process

Note: The dough will triple in size during initial stretch-n-folds. You will need at least a 3-quart container for the recipe as given. I typically do a double batch in an 8-quart clear tub from the restaurant supply store, and it rises from 2 quarts initially to the 6 quart line at max rise.

### Ingredients

*95% hydration dough*
- 500g white bread flour
- 475g water, lukewarm (~110F)
- 20g active sourdough starter
- 2 tsp instant yeast
- 15g salt (about 1 Tbsp kosher salt)

### First day

Dissolve the starter and yeast in the water. Sift the salt into the flour. Combine.
Stir until the dough comes together and some gluten strands develop.

Get a bowl of water to dip your hands in. You will need continuously wet hands and a wet bench scraper to get anywhere near this dough without turning your hands into sticky dough balls. I dip my hands between each time I touch the dough.

Perform 3 stretch & folds at 30-45m intervals to build more tension. You don't need to develop this stuff until it's perfectly round like country bread, it just needs to be coherent and not tear when you stretch it.

Cover and put in the fridge for at least 8 hours, but no more than 24 hours. My flavor sweet spot is 18 hours.

### Second day

Turn out dough onto a well floured surface. Split the dough into 2-4 pieces.
- Split in 2 pieces, this will make long, large loaves that are good for slicing and dipping to share with friends.
- Split in 4 pieces, this will make more traditionally sized loaves that are great for a large sandwich.

OPTIONAL: If you choose to proof the dough for 1-2 more hours, cover it with something that won't stick to it, like mixing bowls. I skip this final proofing step for convenience.

### Prep
Preheat the oven to 500F. 

Line your baking sheet(s), or ideally a Dutch oven / combo cooker, with parchment. Sprinkle with semolina or cornmeal.

If you are not using a closed baking vessel, pre-steam the oven. (I do this by adding an oven-safe dish containing a couple cups of water.)

### Baking
Gently stretch dough piece(s) you are about to bake into an oblong rectangle shape and quickly flip upside down onto the parchment. "Velvet glove, iron fist."

Dust the tops lightly with flour. I find it easiest to shake flour through a fine mesh strainer.

Slide pan into oven and lower heat to 475F.

Bake until golden brown (probably 15-25 minutes depending on how you sized your pieces), rotating mid-bake. If you're using a Dutch oven, also remove the lid at the halfway point.

Let cool for 10+ minutes.

### Results

This was pretty darn good. Very very moist. Fantastic rise with really holey structure.

Note that the holes will be too big to hold toppings if you cut the bread in slices. This bread is designed to be cut in half flat for use as sandwich bread, where the holes can hold lots of stuff but are blocked off by the crust.

### Iteration notes

- I did a round where I held back 1/10 of the water and added it gradually while strengthening the gluten, in hopes this would make it easier to handle. It helped a little but I don't think it wasÂ worth the extra effort for me.

# Variants

- One of my housemates did a variant he calls "Simpleton's Ciabatta", where you do fewer stretch-n-fold steps, proof for less time, throw the entire dough on one baking tray, and skip the oven steaming step.
- Basically you can skip quite a lot of steps and still end up with reasonable tasting fresh bread, even if it gets less artisanal in the process.
