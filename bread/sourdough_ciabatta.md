# High-hydration sourdough ciabatta

Work in progress.
I am optimizing for: super moist tender crumb with big holes, some sourdoughy bready flavor, 
but overall relatively mild and creamy.

Very loosely adapted from [Jason's Quick Cocodrillo Ciabatta](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/2984/jasons-quick-coccodrillo-ciabatta-bread), 
with additional tips in [this comment](http://www.thefreshloaf.com//node/3088/bluezebras-baking-banter#comment-14086). My changes:
- Added sourdough starter
- All gluten formation done by hand. I don't have a mixer and am trying to own fewer tools right now.
- Lowered to 90% hydration because I'm a high-hydration newbie.
- No longer a same-day bread. I added an overnight fermentation.

### Notes

- Using a Dutch oven for the first half of the bake produces a much more aesthetic golden crust than simply baking with a steam pan. Otherwise, I don't think it changed the flavor/texture substantially.
- SOPPING WET HANDS ARE YOUR ONLY DEFENSE AGAINST THE SUPERGLUE THAT IS HIGH HYDRATION DOUGH. RE-WET YOUR HANDS & SCRAPER LIKE YOUR SANITY DEPENDS ON IT (WHICH IT DOES).

## Trial #1, 3/30

*90% hydration*
- 250g white bread flour
- 225g water, lukewarm (110F?)
- 20g active sourdough starter
- 8 g salt
- 1 tsp instant yeast

Stir until the dough comes together and gluten strands develop, about 15-20 minutes. 
Perform 3 stretch & folds at 30-45m intervals to build more tension. 
At this point I fridged overnight because it was getting late.

When the dough has tripled (I checked 12 hours later), turn out onto a well floured surface. 
*You will need wet hands and a wet bench scraper to get anywhere near this dough.* 
At this point, you can split the dough if you want multiple pieces. 

I did a couple of stretch & folds even though that's not recommended at this stage.

When it looks poofy (1-2 hrs), preheat the oven to 500F and line a pan with parchment. 
Gently stretch the dough into a 10" oblong rectangle and quickly flip it upside down onto the parchment.

Slide pan into oven and lower heat to 475F. 
Bake until golden brown or 205F in the center (15-25 minutes), rotating the pan halfway through.

Let cool for as long as you can stand not to eat fresh bread. I lasted about 30 minutes.

### Commentary

This was pretty darn good. Crust was dull and rough looking, but crumb looked as good as photos from more experienced bakers. Very very moist.

**Things to try changing next time:**
- Hold back some of the water and add it in (possibly with the salt) after the dough has developed some tension. (At this point, am I basically doing an extra-gloopy sourdough country bread?)
- The crust was mediocre looking; I forgot to steam the oven.
- Do more stretch & fold before the fridge step.


## Trial #2, 3/31

*90% hydration*, 500g white bread flour. Water 90F. My starter was not as active this time. I forgot to scale the salt and instant yeast to the doubling, wow.

Hold back 50g water and the salt. Stir until the dough comes together. Stretch and fold in the bowl a few times. Wait to autolyse, 2.5 hrs.

Massage in the held-back 50g water with the salt dissolved in it. Knead until the dough comes together. Stretch and fold in the bowl until passing the windowpane test.

Fridge overnight 12 hours.

Flour. Bench. Split into 2 pieces. Dust tops with flour and let proof 45 minutes. Steam & preheat oven to 500F. Line pans.

*Gently* stretch dough into final shapes without degassing, and flip upside down onto parchment. Slide into oven.

Lower heat to 475F. Bake for until golden brown (20-25? minutes), rotating the pan midway.

Remove and let cool 20+ minutes.

### Commentary

Less moist, less flavor, and less holey than the first trial. Still good though. 
I messed up quite a lot of ingredient factors because I wasn't looking at a reference, 
and changed quite a lot of process factors, so it's hard to know what happened.

Maybe I need a couche

**What to try next time**

Revert to trial #1, but do more stretch & folds prior to fridging and eliminate the post-fridge stretch & fold.
