Quickref for [delayed fermentation bread](pain_lancienne.md) if you have done it enough times that you no longer need the debugging reasoning

### Ingredients

+ 27 oz bread flour
+ 1 tablespoon kosher salt
+ 2 teaspoons instant yeast
+ 2 cups cold water, plus more if needed

### Dough (5-10 min)

Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl. Add water and quickly mix until fully incorporated. Adjust hydration as necessary.

Immediately cover and refrigerate for 3 days.

### Proof (2-4 hours)

Rise at room temperature until doubled in size.

### Shape & bake (30 min)

Preheat oven to 500F. Set a steam pan with 1+ cup water on the bottom rack.

Flour the dough, stretch into a rectangle, and cut into 4 pieces. Transfer to parchment-lined baking pans. Score the tops with a serrated knife.

Put dough in oven and lower temperature to 475F. Bake for a total of about 20 minutes or until golden brown, rotating the pans halfway through.

Let cool on a wire rack for 10+ minutes.

### Serve

I like to serve with a plate of olive oil, salt, pepper, and a dash of balsamic vinegar.
