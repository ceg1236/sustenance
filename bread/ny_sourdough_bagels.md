# New-York-style sourdough bagels

Adapted from [New York style sourdough bagels - Peter Reinhart | Honest Cooking](http://honestcooking.com/peter-reinharts-new-york-style-bagels-wild-sourdough/), with some information from the bagel section in [The Bread Baker's Apprentice](https://www.amazon.com/Bread-Bakers-Apprentice-15th-Anniversary/dp/1607748657/), also by Peter Reinhart. (Disclaimer: I am not from NY, but I've been calibrating these bagels on people who grew up in NY.)

Main differences:
- Moved the shaping step to after the cold fermentation, because I don't have room in my fridge for a whole tray of bagels.
- Increased hydration ratio a couple percent.

### Scheduling

Start thinking about bagels 48 hours before you want to eat them (or more if your starter has been inactive for a while). Bagels are really easy to work into a busy schedule.

- T-2 days: Feed starter (2x/day until ready)
- T-1 AM: Mix sponge in morning (10m)
- T-1 PM: Mix dough at night (15m)
- T+0 Baking day: Boil & bake in the evening (1-2hr)

## Ingredients

| **Ingredient** | **Full recipe** (makes 12) | **Halved recipe** (makes 6) |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| *Sponge* | | |
| ripe 100% hydration wheat sourdough starter | | |
| high-gluten flour | 500 g (4 cups) | 250 g (2 cups) |
| non-chlorinated water | 500 mL (2 cups) | 250 mL (1 cup) |
| *Dough* | | |
| sourdough sponge (above) | | |
| high-gluten flour | 350 g to start, up to 500 g | 175 g to start, up to 250 g |
| barley malt | 2 tsp | 1 tsp |
| salt | 1 Tbsp | 1-1/2 tsp |
| dry yeast | 1 tsp | 1/2 tsp |

Use high-gluten (14%) flour if possible to find. Otherwise, normal 12% gluten bread flour is ok.

### White:wheat ratio

I've been mostly using all white bread flour, sometimes subbing 1/8 of it with whole wheat.

## Instructions

### Sponge

Once your starter is very active, make the sponge. Mix ingredients until lumps are gone. Cover with plastic and leave for 6-10 hours. Sponge is ready when very foamy and stretchy, and when it passes the float test.

### Dough

Mix dry ingredients and then mix together with the sponge until incorporated.

Knead the dough until smooth and elastic. Your goal is dough that is tough and non-sticky. If sticky, you may need to add more flour. If you see tears or stretch marks, dip your hands in water or add a few drops of water.

Continue kneading the dough 10 minutes by hook or 15 minutes by hand until fully smooth and elastic.

Cover and refrigerate at least overnight, preferably between 16 and 36 hours. 18-22 hours is my sweet spot.

### Proof & shape

Divide the dough into 12 pieces (or 6 for the half-recipe). Pieces should weigh 110-120g. (The size has a finicky result on the final texture; see note below.)

Shape the pieces into rolls on a *clean surface*. Cover with damp towel and let them rest 20 minutes.

Roll out each roll so you can wrap it around your fingers with the ends overlapped. Roll the overlap back and forth until fused into a bagel shape. Cover and let them rise another 20 minutes. Make sure you give them extra space, as they will get bigger.

Float test. If a bagel doesn't float, gently dry it off and wait another 20 minutes.

#### Note on sizing

I've been making bagels that average 115g by pre-boiling dough weight. All my numbers here are calibrated to that size. If you change by as much as 10-15%, you will experience a qualitatively noticeable difference in softness, poofiness, necessary boiling time, and necessary baking time, and may need to recalibrate to find out what works for you.

### Boil & bake

Preheat oven to 500F.

Bring a wide pot or deep saucepan of water, plus 1 Tbsp baking soda, to a rolling boil. Leave heat on high to ensure rapid boil. In the meantime, prep your bagel toppings and line a baking sheet with parchment.

When water is at a rolling boil, carefully lower bagels (as many at a time as fit comfortably) in with a spatula or slotted spoon. Let them boil 60-90 seconds on each side.

Move bagels to a parchment-lined baking sheet. (I do 6 bagels to a sheet; if you overcrowd, the heat distribution may result in less crust browning.) Sprinkle bagels with toppings immediately, as this is when they are the stickiest.

Lower the oven to 475F. Bake for a total of 20 minutes or until a light golden-brown. (If baking a second batch, check earlier.) Midway through, rotate the pan.

Let cool on rack.

## Appendix

### Storage

Bagels can be frozen after the fridge step, or after they are fully baked and cooled. If you use frozen dough, thaw for 1 hour prior to boiling.

### Toppings
- shredded parmesan
- roughly chopped garlic
- everything bagel seasoning
- cheddar with everything seasoning on top
