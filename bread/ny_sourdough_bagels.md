# New-York-style sourdough bagels

Adapted from [New York style sourdough bagels - Peter Reinhart | Honest Cooking](http://honestcooking.com/peter-reinharts-new-york-style-bagels-wild-sourdough/), with some information from the bagel section in [The Bread Baker's Apprentice](https://www.amazon.com/Bread-Bakers-Apprentice-15th-Anniversary/dp/1607748657/), also by Peter Reinhart. (Disclaimer: I am not from NY and don't have an authentic NY bagel memory to compare these against.)

Main differences:
- Moved the shaping step to after the cold fermentation, because I don't have room in my fridge for a whole tray of bagels.
- Increased hydration ratio a couple percent.

### Scheduling

Start thinking about bagels 3 days before you want to eat them.

- Starter: feed AM/PM, a day before making sponge
- Sponge: morning before
- Dough: night before
- Bagels: 12-36 hours later

## Ingredients

| **Ingredient**      | **Full recipe** | **Halved recipe** |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| *Sponge* | | |
| ripe 100% hydration wheat sourdough starter | | |
| high-gluten flour | 500 g (4 cups) | 250 g (2 cups) |
| non-chlorinated water | 500 mL (2 cups) | 250 mL (1 cup) |
| *Dough* | | |
| sourdough sponge (above) | | |
| high-gluten flour | 350 g to start, up to 500 g | 175 g to start, up to 250 g |
| barley malt | 2 tsp | 1 tsp |
| salt | 1 Tbsp | 1-1/2 tsp |
| dry yeast | 1 tsp | 1/2 tsp |

Use high-gluten (14%) flour if possible to find. Otherwise, bread flour (12%) is ok.

## Instructions

### Sponge

Mix ingredients until lumps are gone. Cover with plastic and leave for at least 6-8 hours. Sponge is ready when very foamy and stretchy, and when it passes the float test.

### Dough

Mix dry ingredients and then mix together with the sponge until incorporated.

Knead the dough until smooth and elastic. Your goal is dough that is tough and non-sticky. If sticky, you may need to add more flour. If you see tears or stretch marks, dip your hands in water or add a few drops of water.

Continue kneading the dough 10 minutes by hook or 15 minutes by hand until fully smooth and elastic.

Cover and refrigerate at least overnight, preferably as much as 36 hours.

### Proof & shape

Divide the dough into 4oz (110g) pieces. (The size is important for the final texture. If you want to make smaller, 80g bagels, you will have to reduce boiling time.) Shape the pieces into rolls on a *clean surface*. Cover with damp towel and let them rest 20 minutes.

Roll out each roll so you can wrap it around your fingers with the ends overlapped. Roll the overlap back and forth until fused into a bagel shape. Cover and let them rise another 20 minutes. Make sure you give them extra space, as they will get bigger.

Float test. If a bagel doesn't float, wait another 20 minutes.

### Boil & bake

Preheat oven to 500F. Line a baking sheet with parchment.

Bring a wide pot or deep saucepan of water, plus 1 Tbsp baking soda, to a rolling boil. Leave heat on high to ensure rapid boil. In the meantime, get out your bagel toppings.

Carefully lower bagels 3-4 at a time into the boiling pot with a spatula or slotted spoon. Let them boil 60 seconds on each side.

Move bagels to baking sheet. You can optionally brush them with a beaten egg for extra browning. Sprinkle bagels with toppings now, as this is when they are the stickiest.

Bake for a total of 20-25 minutes or until a light golden-brown. 10 minutes in, rotate the sheet and lower the temperature to 450F.

Let cool on rack.

## Appendix

### Storage

Bagels can be frozen after the fridge step, or after they are fully baked and cooled. If you use frozen dough, thaw for 1 hour prior to boiling.

### Toppings
- shredded parmesan
- roughly chopped garlic
- everything bagel seasoning
