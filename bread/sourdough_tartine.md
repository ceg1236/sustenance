# Sourdough
Based on mmou's adaptation of https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-sourdough-bread-224367, which is based on Chad Robertson's Tartine Bread recipe.

Assumes you already have a sourdough starter.

## MAKES
2 boules (round loaves).

Not too sour, tender and holey crumb but not too holey, crunchy crust.

## EQUIPMENT
- Oven capable of 500F
- Mixing bowls
- Cotton towels to line bowls for proofing (flour sack towels work well)
- Plastic wrap or other moisture-proof covering for the bowls
- Dutch ovens or large heavy-bottomed pots with lids
- Pastry scraper
- Serrated bread knife
 
## SCHEDULING
You must make the leaven, autolyse, bulk rise, middle rise, and shape on the same day. If you have ~5 hours left in your day, you can proof and bake; otherwise proof overnight and wait to bake the next day.

**Example schedule** (labeled "babysitting" if I can't leave the house for more than an hour):
- Thurs, Fri (flexible): Feed starter every AM and PM.
- Sat AM (2-4 hrs babysitting): Make leaven, mix dough.
- Sat (flexible): Autolyse. Rest 30min to 4 hrs.
- Sat PM (4.5 hrs babysitting): Bulk rise, middle cycle, shaping.
- Proof overnight in fridge.
- Sun AM (1.5 hrs babysitting): Bake.

## INSTRUCTIONS

### STARTER

Make sure your sourdough culture is active. If your sourdough has been in the refrigerator, take it out 1-3 days before you plan to bake. Feed it twice daily, AM and PM, to make sure it's strong and very active before you make the bread. It should be very bubbly and have a pleasantly sour smell.

It's convenient to maintain a small starter. I just leave the scrapings in my jar (a spoonful or less) and either discard my excess starter or use it up in bagels, etc.

### LEAVEN (~3 hrs, mostly waiting)

**Ingredients**
- 1 heaping tablespoon active sourdough starter
- 75 grams bread flour
- 75 grams water

The morning you plan to make the dough, place all the leaven ingredients in a large bowl and mix thoroughly. Cover and let stand at room temperature. Float test every hour. (For me, it tends to be ready after 3 hours.)

**Leaven float test:** Drop a small sacrificial bit of the leaven in a cup of water; if it floats, it's ready.

### DOUGH

**Ingredients**
- 500 grams water, divided (a small amount of water will be set aside to dissolve your salt in)
- 1 tablespoon sea salt
- 700 grams bread flour (5 1/2 cups)

#### AUTOLYSE (1-4 hrs)
*During this stage, the flour is fully absorbing the water and enzymes in the flour begin breaking down the starches and proteins.*

1. (~20 minutes) Add **450 grams** of water to the bowl of leaven and stir. It's okay if there are still some clumps. Add the flour. Add the flour and stir until fully incorporated into an extremely shaggy, sticky dough. (If needed, you can add more water VERY GRADUALLY. Start with just wetted hands for minor adjustment, or you can add *small* spoonfuls at a time if dough is visibly dry. It's very easy to add too much water. Document how much you needed to adjust by.)

1. REST (30 minutes to 4 hours): Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours.

#### BULK RISE (3-3.5 hrs)

*Folding is used for gluten formation in place of kneading. This will give you a more holey crumb.*

1. Fully dissolve the salt in the remaining 50 grams of water. (50 isn't a particularly specific number, as long as it's any small amount that you accurately subtracted out of the total hydration amount. It's just easier to pick a number in advance than to keep track of a cup of set-aside water for 4 hours.)

1. (~10 minutes) Pour the dissolved salt over the dough. Work into the dough until fully incorporated. The dough should feel shaggy, a bit loose, and stick to your hands some. It will gradually end up building more tension throughout the bulk rise step. If too dry (not fully incorporated, inelastic, or too dry to stick to hands) or too wet (so floppy/wet that it does not stick to hands), adjust as needed and document adjustments for next time.

1. FOLDING (6 times, 2.5 hrs): Begin folding the dough (2 1/2 hours). To fold the dough, grab the dough at one side, lift it up, and fold it over on top of itself. Fold the dough four times from each cardinal direction. Let the dough rest 30 minutes, then repeat. Do this a total of 6 times, every half hour, for a total of 2 1/2 hours. By the end, the dough should still be a little bit shaggy and sticky, but should release from the sides of the bowl when lifted.

1. RISE (30-60 min): Let the dough rise undisturbed (30 to 60 minutes). Once you've finished the folds, cover and let the dough rise undisturbed for 30 to 60 minutes, until it looks slightly puffed. This dough won't double in size the way regular, non-sourdough breads will; it should just look larger than it did when you started.

#### MIDDLE CYCLE (40 min)

*Shaping builds tension in the dough surface.*

1. DIVIDE: Sprinkle some flour on a work surface and turn the dough out on top. Work gently to avoid deflating the dough. Divide the dough in half.

1. SHAPE (~5 minutes): Sprinkle a little flour over each piece of dough. Use your pastry scraper to shape each one into loose rounds — this isn't the final shaping, just a preliminary shaping to prep the dough for further shaping. Shape them into rounds by slipping your pastry scraper under the edge of the dough and then scraping it around curve of the dough, like turning left when driving. Do this a few times to build the surface tension in the dough (it makes more sense to do it than to read about it!). Flour your pastry scraper as needed to keep it from sticking to the dough.

1. REST (30 min): Once both pieces of dough are shaped, let them rest to relax the gluten again before final shaping.

#### FINAL SHAPING

1. (~5 minutes) While the dough is resting, line 2 bread proofing baskets, colanders, or clean mixing bowls with clean kitchen towels. Dust them heavily with flour, rubbing the flour into the cloth on the bottom and up the sides with your fingers.

1. FINAL SHAPING (~10 minutes): Dust the top of one of the balls of dough with flour. Flip it over with a pastry scraper so that the floured side is against the board and the un-floured, sticky surface is up. Shape the loaf much like you folded the dough earlier: Grab the lip of the dough at the bottom, pull it gently up, then fold it over onto the center of the dough. Repeat with all four sides. (If the resulting ball easily flattens out or doesn't seem taut to you, make a note to slightly decrease hydration next time.) Repeat with the second ball of dough.

1. PANNING: Gently dust the tops and sides of the shaped loaves with flour so that they are powdery dry to the touch. Place them into the proofing baskets upside down, so the seams from shaping are on top, and then dust that side with flour too.

### PROOFING (3-4 hrs or overnight in fridge)

*Final fermentation.*

- Cover the baskets loosely with plastic wrap, or place them inside clean plastic bags.
- Let them rise at room temperature until they look billowy and poofy, 3-4 hours.
- Alternatively, place the covered basket in the refrigerator and let them rise slowly overnight, 12-18 hours. If rising overnight, bake the loaves straight from the fridge; no need to warm before baking.

### BAKING (1.5 hrs to eat)

1. Place two Dutch ovens or other heavy-bottomed pots with lids in the oven, and preheat to 500°F. (If you don't have two pots, you can bake one loaf after the next.)

1. Score the top of the loaf. Use a serrated bread knife to quickly score the surface of the loaves. Try to score at a slight angle, so you're cutting almost parallel to the surface of the loaf; this gives the loaves the distinctive "shelf" along the score line. I find it easier to tip the loaf into one hand (it should be firm enough to hold without spilling) and score while holding, rather than try to score when the loaf is already in the Dutch oven.

1. Transfer loaf to Dutch oven. Carefully remove Dutch oven from the oven and tip the loaf into the pot so the seam-side is down. (See Recipe Note if your loaf sticks to the basket.)

1. BAKE (20 min, covered): Reduce the oven temperature to 475°F. Cover the Dutch oven. Bake for 20 minutes.

1. BAKE (~20 min, uncovered): Uncover the pots to release any remaining steam. At this point, the loaf should have "sprung" up, have a dry surface, and be just beginning to show golden color. Remove the lids and continue baking until the crust is dark golden-brown to deeply browned, about 15-25 minutes. It might feel a bit unnatural to bake loaves this fully, but this is where a lot of the flavor and texture of the crust comes in. If the top needs more color but the bottom is close to burning, you can finish the bake with the loaf out of the pan and directly on the oven rack. The top color is also helped by having the oven rack closer to the top of the oven. You may wish to rotate midway if your oven's heat distribution is uneven.

1. COOLING: When done, carefully lift the loaves out of the pots using a utensil. Transfer them to wire racks to cool completely, at least 10 minutes. Do not attempt to artificially accelerate the cooling -- the loaves are still cooking on the inside, and this is part of the process.

## PROCESS NOTES
- Whole-wheat sourdough: You can replace up to half of the all-purpose flour with whole-wheat or whole-grain flour.

- All-purpose vs. bread flour: Bread flour will give your bread a sturdier, chewier texture and a loaf that's easier to slice. Loaves made with all-purpose flour will be a bit more delicate, especially when you cut them, but still work just fine.

- If your loaf sticks to the proofing basket and tears: Fold a pinch of dough over the tear and bake as usual.

- Storage: Bread can be stored at room temperature (cut-side down if cut) in a paper bag for up to 3 days well wrapped in plastic wrap and frozen for up to 2 months.

- Cleaning your proofing towel [[MetaFilter](https://ask.metafilter.com/55323/how-to-wash-out-flour)]: beat the towel out and/or vacuum it while dry. Soak in warm water for an hour or so, then scrub with a bristle brush. I use a tawashi brush.
