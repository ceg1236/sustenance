# Sourdough
Based on mmou's adaptation of https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-sourdough-bread-224367, which is based on Chad Robertson's Tartine Bread recipe.

## MAKES
2 loaves.

Not too sour, tender and holey crumb but not too holey, crunchy crust.

## INGREDIENTS

### For the leaven:
- 1 tablespoon active sourdough starter
- 75 grams bread flour
- 75 grams water

### For the dough:
- 525 grams water, divided
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 700 grams bread flour (5 1/2 cups)

## EQUIPMENT
- 500F oven
- Mixing bowls
- Cotton towels to line bowls for proofing
- Plastic wrap or other covering for the bowls
- Pastry scraper (if you have it)
- Dutch ovens or large heavy-bottomed pots with lids
- Serrated knife
 
## SCHEDULING
You must make the leaven, autolyse, bulk rise, middle rise, and shape on the same day. If you have ~5 hours left in your day, you can proof and bake; otherwise proof overnight and wait to bake the next day.

**Example schedule** (labeled "babysitting" if I can't leave the house for more than an hour):
- Thurs, Fri (flexible): Feed starter every AM and PM.
- Sat AM (2-4 hrs babysitting): Make leaven, mix dough.
- Sat (flexible): Autolyse. Rest 30min to 4 hrs.
- Sat PM (4.5 hrs babysitting): Bulk rise, middle cycle, shaping.
- Proof overnight in fridge.
- Sun AM (1.5 hrs babysitting): Bake.

## INSTRUCTIONS

### STARTER

(1-3 days before baking): Make sure your sourdough culture is active. If your sourdough has been in the refrigerator, take it out 2 to 3 days before you plan to bake. Feed it twice daily to make sure it's strong and very active before you make the bread.

It's convenient to maintain a small starter.

### LEAVEN (2+ hrs)

The morning you plan to make the dough, place all the leaven ingredients in a large bowl and mix thoroughly. Cover and let stand at room temperature. Float test every hour.

FLOAT TEST FOR LEAVEN: Drop a small sacrificial bit of the leaven in a cup of water; if it floats, it's ready.

### DOUGH

#### AUTOLYSE (30 min - 4 hrs)
*During this stage, the flour is fully absorbing the water and enzymes in the flour begin breaking down the starches and proteins.*

1. Add the water minus 50 grams (which will be used to dissolve salt later) to the bowl of leaven and stir. It's okay if there are still some clumps.

1. Add the flour. Add the flour and stir until fully incorporated into a very shaggy dough.

1. REST (30 minutes, or up to 4 hours): Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Let the dough rest for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours.

#### BULK RISE (3-3.5 hrs)

*Folding is used for gluten formation in place of kneading. This will give you a more holey crumb.*

1. Fully dissolve the salt in the remaining 50 grams of water.

1. Pour the dissolved salt over the dough. Work the liquid and salt into the dough by pinching and squeezing the dough. The dough will feel quite wet and loose at this point.

1. FOLDING (6 times, 2.5 hrs): Begin folding the dough (2 1/2 hours). To fold the dough, grab the dough at one side, lift it up, and fold it over on top of itself. Fold the dough four times from each cardinal direction. Let the dough rest 30 minutes, then repeat. Do this a total of 6 times, every half hour, for a total of 2 1/2 hours. The dough will start out shaggy and very loose, but will gradually smooth out and become tighter as you continue folding.

1. RISE (30-60 min): Let the dough rise undisturbed (30 to 60 minutes). Once you've finished the folds, cover and let the dough rise undisturbed for 30 to 60 minutes, until it looks slightly puffed. This dough won't double in size the way regular, non-sourdough breads will; it should just look larger than it did when you started.

#### MIDDLE CYCLE (40 min)

*Shaping builds tension in the dough surface.*

1. DIVIDE: Sprinkle some flour on a work surface and turn the dough out on top. Work gently to avoid deflating the dough. Divide the dough in half.

1. SHAPE: Sprinkle a little flour over each piece of dough. Use your pastry scraper to shape each one into loose rounds — this isn't the final shaping, just a preliminary shaping to prep the dough for further shaping. Shape them into rounds by slipping your pastry scraper under the edge of the dough and then scraping it around curve of the dough, like turning left when driving. Do this a few times to build the surface tension in the dough (it makes more sense to do it than to read about it!). Flour your pastry scraper as needed to keep it from sticking to the dough.

1. REST (30 min): Once both pieces of dough are shaped, let them rest to relax the gluten again before final shaping.

#### FINAL SHAPING

1. Line 2 bread proofing baskets, colanders, or clean mixing bowls with clean kitchen towels. Dust them heavily with flour, rubbing the flour into the cloth on the bottom and up the sides with your fingers. Use more flour than you think you'll need — it should form a thin layer over the surface of the towel.

1. FINAL SHAPING: Dust the top of one of the balls of dough with flour. Flip it over with a pastry scraper so that the floured side is against the board and the un-floured, sticky surface is up. Shape the loaf much like you folded the dough earlier: Grab the lip of the dough at the bottom, pull it gently up, then fold it over onto the center of the dough. Repeat with the right and left side of the dough. Repeat with the top of the dough, but once you fold it downward, use your thumb to grab the bottom lip again and gently roll the dough right-side up. If it's not quite a round or doesn't seem taut to you, cup your palms around the dough and rotate it against the counter to shape it up. Repeat with the second ball of dough.

1. PANNING: Transfer to the proofing baskets. Dust the tops and sides of the shaped loaves generously with flour. Place them into the proofing baskets upside down, so the seams from shaping are on top.

### PROOFING (3-4 hrs or overnight in fridge)

*Final fermentation.*

- Cover the baskets loosely with plastic wrap, or place them inside clean plastic bags.
- Let them rise at room temperature until they look billowy and poofy, 3 to 4 hours.
- Alternatively, place the covered basket in the refrigerator and let them rise slowly overnight, 12 to 15 hours. If rising overnight, bake the loaves straight from the fridge; no need to warm before baking.

### BAKING (1.5 hrs to eat)

1. Place two Dutch ovens or other heavy-bottomed pots with lids in the oven, and preheat to 500°F. (If you don't have two pots, you can bake one loaf after the next.)

1. Transfer the loaves to the Dutch ovens. Carefully remove one of the heated Dutch ovens from the oven and remove the lid. Tip the loaf into the pot so the seam-side is down. Repeat with the second loaf. (See Recipe Note if your loaf sticks to the basket.)

1. Score the top of the loaf. Use a razor or very sharp knife to quickly score the surface of the loaves. Try to score at a slight angle, so you're cutting almost parallel to the surface of the loaf; this gives the loaves the distinctive "shelf" along the score line.

1. BAKE (20 min, covered): Reduce the oven temperature to 450°F. Cover the Dutch oven. Bake for 20 minutes.

1. BAKE (~20 min, uncovered): Uncover the pots to release any remaining steam. At this point, the loaves should have "sprung" up, have a dry surface, and be just beginning to show golden color. Remove the lids and continue baking until the crust is deeply browned, about 15-25 minutes; aim for just short of burnt. It might feel a bit unnatural to bake loaves this fully, but this is where a lot of the flavor and texture of the crust comes in. If the top needs more color but the bottom is close to burning, you can finish the bake with the loaf out of the pan and directly on the oven rack. The top color is also helped by having the oven rack closer to the top of the oven.

1. COOLING: When done, lift the loaves out of the pots using a utensil. Transfer them to wire racks to cool completely, at least 10 minutes. Do not attempt to artificially accelerate the cooling -- the loaves are still cooking on the inside, and this is part of the process.

## RECIPE NOTES
- Whole-wheat sourdough: You can replace up to half of the all-purpose flour with whole-wheat or whole-grain flour.

- All-purpose vs. bread flour: Bread flour will give your bread a sturdier, chewier texture and a loaf that's easier to slice. Loaves made with all-purpose flour will be a bit more delicate, especially when you cut them, but still work just fine.

- If your loaf sticks to the proofing basket and tears: Fold a pinch of dough over the tear and bake as usual.

- Storage: Bread can be stored at room temperature (cut-side down if cut) in a paper bag for up to 3 days well wrapped in plastic wrap and frozen for up to 2 months.
