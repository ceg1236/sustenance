Norwegian seedy bread. 
[original recipe from Arctic Grub blog](https://arcticgrub.com/seeded-whole-grain-no-knead-bread/)

changes: got rid of sugar, did 3 stretch & folds

## ingredients
- 130g WW flour
- 100g dark rye flour
- 360g white flour
- 1/2 cup (50g) rolled oats
- 3/4 cup (90g) of mixed seeds: sunflower, pumpkin, flax
- 1/2 tsp active dry yeast
- 1 Tbsp coarse salt
- 2.5 c (600mL) water

## methodology
- mix yeast in lukewarm water. mix dry ingredients separately. combine thoroughly
- cover & rest dough 12-20 hours (I like 18 hours) at room temp. DO NOT exceed 20 hours or it will taste like flat soda.
- USE WET HANDS, stretch & fold, rest 30-60m. repeat stretch & folds more times if needed
- preheat dutch oven 450F, start preheating 30m in advance
- put parchment paper in the bottom to prevent sticking. (could also try cornmeal but I haven't done this yet)
- dump in dough, top dough with extra seeds, drizzle of oil, and a pinch of flaky sea salt
- bake 30m covered, 15m uncovered

## notes for attempt 1
- did 3 stretch & folds in 70F kitchen. gluten development was still just adequate, would have preferred 2x stronger handfeel
- rise was in the 1.5x range (linear height in proofing tub)
- definite crowd pleaser, will be doing this again
- some bread did get stuck to the bottom of the pan so I will use parchment paper next time
