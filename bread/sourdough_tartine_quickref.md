# Tartine sourdough quickref

Quick reference for making 2 loaves of [sourdough_tartine.md](sourdough_tartine.md) if you have already done this a few times, calibrated the measurements to your kitchen environment, and no longer need the explanations.

Use bread flour, defaulting to unbleached. You can substitute whole wheat up to 50%. If using all unbleached, use the lower end of the hydration scale. If using more whole wheat, use the higher end.

### STARTER
Feed in AM/PM, at least three times before you start the dough.

### LEVAIN (3+ hrs)
+ *1 heaping Tbsp sourdough starter*
+ *75 grams bread flour*
+ *75 grams water*

Cover and float test once an hour, starting at 3 hours, until ready.

### DOUGH (minimum 4.5 hrs)

Pick a hydration level.

Hydration | Post-levain water
:--- | ---
74% | 500g (divided 450 + 50)
78% | 530g (divided 480 + 50)
82% | 560g (divided 510 + 50)

#### AUTOLYSE (15m active + 0.5-4 hrs wait time)
+ *450-510 grams water*
+ *700 grams bread flour*

Stir water into levain, then flour, until fully incorporated. Cover and let rest for 30 min to 4 hours.

Plan so that you will have a 4-hour continuous block in which to tend to the bulk rise, middle cycle, and shaping.

#### BULK RISE (3 hrs)
+ *1 tablespoon sea salt*
+ *50 grams water*

Fully dissolve the salt in the water. Fully incorporate into dough. Should be shaggy and sticky. May stick to the bowl.

Fold dough from every direction. 6 times, once every half hour. Use wet hands to gently adjust hydration level if dough seems too dry. By the end, should be a smooth round mass, but still floppy.

Let rest for 30 minutes.

#### MIDDLE CYCLE (40 min)

Flour a work surface. Divide the dough in half.

Lightly flour each piece and shape into rounds with your pastry scraper.

Let rest for 30 minutes. While you wait, line two bowls/baskets with clean flour sack towels. Rub flour into them. 

#### FINAL SHAPING (10 min)

Dust dough with flour. Flip and increase surface tension by gently pulling all four sides over into the middle with your pastry scraper.

Dust with flour all over and place into lined proofing bowls/baskets so the seam side is up.

### PROOF

Cover and rise in fridge for 12+ hours, or at room temp for 3-4 hours.

### BAKE (1.5-2 hrs)

Place Dutch oven(s) in the oven and preheat to 500F.

When preheat is finished, take out the Dutch oven. Take dough out of fridge and score deeply at an angle with a serrated bread knife. Drop dough into Dutch oven.

Reduce temperature to 475F. **Bake covered for 20 minutes.** Meanwhile, soak the flour-covered towel in hot water and/or scrub with a bristle brush to get the flour off.

Remove the lid and **bake uncovered for another 20 minutes** (or until a deep brown by sight).

Transfer to wire rack and let cool for 10+ minutes.

### SERVE

I'm a fan of salted butter and goat cheese.
