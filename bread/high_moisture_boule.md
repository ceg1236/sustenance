Adapted from *Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes A Day* (Jeff Hertzberg, Zoe Francois)

### Ingredients (makes 4 1-pound loaves)
+ 3 cups lukewarm water, 100F
+ 1-1/2 tablespoons granulated yeast
+ 1-1/2 tablespoons kosher salt
+ 6-1/2 cups unbleached white flour

### Dough

In a 5 quart bowl, combine the yeast, salt, and water. Mix in the flour until fully incorporated. No need to knead.

Rise at room temperature until it begins to collapse or flattens on top, about 2 hours.

You can use the dough now, but it's best to rest in the fridge overnight first.

Dough may be stored in a lidded, non-airtight container for up to 14 days.

### Shaping

Sprinkle refrigerated dough with flour. Cut off a 1 lb (grapefruit-size) piece of dough with a serrated knife. Take a minute to cloak & shape a loaf by gently stretching the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all four sides.

Rest loaf 40 minutes on a cornmeal-covered pizza peel.

### Baking

Preheat oven to 450F with a baking stone on the middle rack. Place a steam pan of water on any other shelf.

After 20 minutes, slide the loaf onto the preheated baking stone. Bake for about 30 minutes or until browned.

Cool on a wire rack.

## Notes

+ Don't wash your dough bucket when finished -- mix a new batch in the same container to get a headstart on sourdough flavor.
