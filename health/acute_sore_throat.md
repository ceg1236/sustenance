acute sore throat
-----
researched this during crippling bout of tonsillitis. note that antibiotics are prescribed because they reduce contagion time from ~2 weeks to ~24 hours after antibiotics, and to eliminate the (very rare, but life-threatening) risk of rheumatic fever. so take them, but here are other things that will help in the meantime.

### to do frequently
1. warm salt water gargle (studies mostly demonstrate efficacy of plain water gargles, but a little osmosis doesnâ€™t hurt)
2. honey shots [[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3609166/)][[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26050853)] (+ can add honey in everything to follow to make it more palatable)

### additional assistance backed by data
1. ðŸŒŸ echinacea/sage topical (similar efficacy to chlorhexidine/lidocaine as an antimicrobial/anesthetic for acute sore throat treatment [[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3351972/)]). make a strong tea infusion from dried leaf, which can then be used as a gargle or spray. this was my favorite, it needed to be reapplied often but dulled the acute pain almost immediately.
2. make a tea from honey, lemon, ginger, cloves[[3](http://www.bioline.org.br/pdf?gm05035)][[4](https://www.ijrap.net/admin/php/uploads/360_pdf.pdf)][[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8904847)]
3. raw crushed garlic [[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29109311)][[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30397374)] (chew on a whole clove, suck on a piece, or crush it and add honey)
4. warm compress on external swollen areas
